S. Eliot, Family Reunion\nChapter 0\nI am an invisible man. No, I am not a spook like those who haunted\nEdgar Allan Poe; nor am I one of your Hollywood-movie ectoplasms. I am a\nman of substance, of flesh and bone, fiber and liquids -- and I might even be\nsaid to possess a mind. I am invisible, understand, simply because people\nrefuse to see me. Like the bodiless heads you see sometimes in circus\nsideshows, it is as though I have been surrounded by mirrors of hard,\ndistorting glass. When they approach me they see only my surroundings,\nthemselves, or figments of their imagination -- indeed, everything and\nanything except me.\nNor is my invisibility exactly a matter of a bio-chemical accident to\nmy epidermis. That invisibility to which I refer occurs because of a peculiar\ndisposition of the eyes of those with whom I come in contact. A matter of\nthe construction of their inner eyes, those eyes with which they look through\ntheir physical eyes upon reality. I am not complaining, nor am I protesting\neither. It is sometimes advantageous to be unseen, although it is most often\nrather wearing on the nerves. Then too, you\'re constantly being bumped\nagainst by those of poor vision. Or again, you often doubt if you really exist.\nYou wonder whether you aren\'t simply a phantom in other people\'s minds.\nSay, a figure in a nightmare which the sleeper tries with all his strength to\ndestroy. It\'s when you feel like this that, out of resentment, you begin to\nbump people back. And, let me confess, you feel that way most of the time.\nYou ache with the need to convince yourself that you do exist in the real\nworld, that you\'re a part of all the sound and anguish, and you strike out\nwith your fists, you curse and you swear to make them recognize you. And,\nalas, it\'s seldom successful.\nOne night I accidentally bumped into a man, and perhaps because of\nthe near darkness he saw me and called me an insulting name. I sprang at\nhim, seized his coat lapels and demanded that he apologize. He was a tall\nblond man, and as my face came close to his he looked insolently out of his\nblue eyes and cursed me, his breath hot in my face as he struggled. I pulled\nhis chin down sharp upon the crown of my head, butting him as I had seen\nthe West Indians do, and I felt his flesh tear and the blood gush out, and I\nyelled, "Apologize! Apologize!" But he continued to curse and struggle, and I\nbutted him again and again until he went down heavily, on his knees,\nprofusely bleeding. I kicked him repeatedly, in a frenzy because he still\nuttered insults though his lips were frothy with blood. Oh yes, I kicked him!\nAnd in my outrage I got out my knife and prepared to slit his throat, right\nthere beneath the lamplight in the deserted street, holding him by the collar\nwith one hand, and opening the knife with my teeth -- when it occurred to\nme that the man had not seen me, actually; that he, as far as he knew, was\nin the midst of a walking nightmare! And I stopped the blade, slicing the air\nas I pushed him away, letting him fall back to the street. I stared at him\nhard as the lights of a car stabbed through the darkness. He lay there,\nmoaning on the asphalt; a man almost killed by a phantom. It unnerved me.\nI was both disgusted and ashamed. I was like a drunken man myself,\nwavering about on weakened legs. Then I was amused. Something in this\nman\'s thick head had sprung out and beaten him within an inch of his life. I\nbegan to laugh at this crazy discovery. Would he have awakened at the point\nof death? Would Death himself have freed him for wakeful living? But I\ndidn\'t linger. I ran away into the dark, laughing so hard I feared I might\nrupture myself. The next day I saw his picture in the Daily News, beneath a\ncaption stating that he had been "mugged." Poor fool, poor blind fool, I\nthought with sincere compassion, mugged by an invisible man!\nMost of the time (although I do not choose as I once did to deny\nthe violence of my days by ignoring it) I am not so overtly violent. I\nremember that I am invisible and walk softly so as not to awaken the\nsleeping ones. Sometimes it is best not to awaken them; there are few things\nin the world as dangerous as sleepwalkers. I learned in time though that it is\npossible to carry on a fight against them without their realizing it. For\ninstance, I have been carrying on a fight with Monopolated Light & Power for\nsome time now. I use their service and pay them nothing at all, and they\ndon\'t know it. Oh, they suspect that power is being drained off, but they\ndon\'t know where. All they know is that according to the master meter back\nthere in their power station a hell of a lot of free current is disappearing\nsomewhere into the jungle of Harlem. The joke, of course, is that I don\'t live\nin Harlem but in a border area. Several years ago (before I discovered the\nadvantage of being invisible) I went through the routine process of buying\nservice and paying their outrageous rates. But no more. I gave up all that,\nalong with my apartment, and my old way of life: That way based upon the\nfallacious assumption that I, like other men, was visible. Now, aware of my\ninvisibility, I live rent-free in a building rented strictly to whites, in a section\nof the basement that was shut off and forgotten during the nineteenth\ncentury, which I discovered when I was trying to escape in the night from\nRas the Destroyer. But that\'s getting too far ahead of the story, almost to the\nend, although the end is in the beginning and lies far ahead.\nThe point now is that I found a home -- or a hole in the ground, as\nyou will. Now don\'t jump to the conclusion that because I call my home a\n"hole" it is damp and cold like a grave; there are cold holes and warm holes.\nMine is a warm hole. And remember, a bear retires to his hole for the winter\nand lives until spring; then he comes strolling out like the Easter chick\nbreaking from its shell. I say all this to assure you that it is incorrect to\nassume that, because I\'m invisible and live in a hole, I am dead. I am\nneither dead nor in a state of suspended animation. Call me Jack-the-Bear,\nfor I am in a state of hibernation.\nMy hole is warm and full of light. Yes, full of light. I doubt if there\nis a brighter spot in all New York than this hole of mine, and I do not\nexclude Broadway. Or the Empire State Building on a photographer\'s dream\nnight. But that is taking advantage of you. Those two spots are among the\ndarkest of our whole civilization -- pardon me, our whole culture (an\nimportant distinction, I\'ve heard) -- which might sound like a hoax, or a\ncontradiction, but that (by contradiction, I mean) is how the world moves:\nNot like an arrow, but a boomerang. (Beware of those who speak of the\nspiral of history; they are preparing a boomerang. Keep a steel helmet handy.)\nI know; I have been boomeranged across my head so much that I now can\nsee the darkness of lightness. And I love light. Perhaps you\'ll think it strange\nthat an invisible man should need light, desire light, love light. But maybe it\nis exactly because I am invisible. Light confirms my reality, gives birth to my\nform. A beautiful girl once told me of a recurring nightmare in which she lay\nin the center of a large dark room and felt her face expand until it filled the\nwhole room, becoming a formless mass while her eyes ran in bilious jelly up\nthe chimney. And so it is with me. Without light I am not only invisible, but\nformless as well; and to be unaware of one\'s form is to live a death. I\nmyself, after existing some twenty years, did not become alive until I\ndiscovered my invisibility.\nThat is why I fight my battle with Monopolated Light & Power. The\ndeeper reason, I mean: It allows me to feel my vital aliveness. I also fight\nthem for taking so much of my money before I learned to protect myself. In\nmy hole in the basement there are exactly 1,369 lights. I\'ve wired the entire\nceiling, every inch of it. And not with fluorescent bulbs, but with the older,\nmore-expensive-to-operate kind, the filament type. An act of sabotage, you\nknow. I\'ve already begun to wire the wall. A junk man I know, a man of\nvision, has supplied me with wire and sockets. Nothing, storm or flood, must\nget in the way of our need for light and ever more and brighter light. The\ntruth is the light and light is the truth. When I finish all four walls, then I\'ll\nstart on the floor. Just how that will go, I don\'t know. Yet when you have\nlived invisible as long as I have you develop a certain ingenuity. I\'ll solve the\nproblem. And maybe I\'ll invent a gadget to place my coffeepot on the fire\nwhile I lie in bed, and even invent a gadget to warm my bed -- like the\nfellow I saw in one of the picture magazines who made himself a gadget to\nwarm his shoes! Though invisible, I am in the great American tradition of\ntinkers. That makes me kin to Ford, Edison and Franklin. Call me, since I\nhave a theory and a concept, a "thinker-tinker." Yes, I\'ll warm my shoes; they\nneed it, they\'re usually full of holes. I\'ll do that and more.\nNow I have one radio-phonograph; I plan to have five. There is a\ncertain acoustical deadness in my hole, and when I have music I want to feel\nits vibration, not only with my ear but with my whole body. I\'d like to hear\nfive recordings of Louis Armstrong playing and singing "What Did I Do to Be\nso Black and Blue" -- all at the same time. Sometimes now I listen to Louis\nwhile I have my favorite dessert of vanilla ice cream and sloe gin. I pour the\nred liquid over the white mound, watching it glisten and the vapor rising as\nLouis bends that military instrument into a beam of lyrical sound. Perhaps I\nlike Louis Armstrong because he\'s made poetry out of being invisible. I think\nit must be because he\'s unaware that he is invisible. And my own grasp of\ninvisibility aids me to understand his music. Once when I asked for a\ncigarette, some jokers gave me a reefer, which I lighted when I got home and\nsat listening to my phonograph. It was a strange evening. Invisibility, let me\nexplain, gives one a slightly different sense of time, you\'re never quite on the\nbeat. Sometimes you\'re ahead and sometimes behind. Instead of the swift and\nimperceptible flowing of time, you are aware of its nodes, those points where\ntime stands still or from which it leaps ahead. And you slip into the breaks\nand look around. That\'s what you hear vaguely in Louis\' music.\nOnce I saw a prizefighter boxing a yokel. The fighter was swift and\namazingly scientific. His body was one violent flow of rapid rhythmic action.\nHe hit the yokel a hundred times while the yokel held up his arms in\nstunned surprise. But suddenly the yokel, rolling about in the gale of boxing\ngloves, struck one blow and knocked science, speed and footwork as cold as a\nwell-digger\'s posterior. The smart money hit the canvas. The long shot got the\nnod. The yokel had simply stepped inside of his opponent\'s sense of time. So\nunder the spell of the reefer I discovered a new analytical way of listening to\nmusic. The unheard sounds came through, and each melodic line existed of\nitself, stood out clearly from all the rest, said its piece, and waited patiently\nfor the other voices to speak. That night I found myself hearing not only in\ntime, but in space as well. I not only entered the music but descended, like\nDante, into its depths. And beneath the swiftness of the hot tempo there was\na slower tempo and a cave and I entered it and looked around and heard an\nold woman singing a spiritual as full of Weltschmerz as flamenco, and\nbeneath that lay a still lower level on which I saw a beautiful girl the color\nof ivory pleading in a voice like my mother\'s as she stood before a group of\nslave owners who bid for her naked body, and below that I found a lower\nlevel and a more rapid tempo and I heard someone shout:\n"Brothers and sisters, my text this morning is the \'Blackness of\nBlackness.\' "\nAnd a congregation of voices answered: "That blackness is most\nblack, brother, most black . . ."\n"In the beginning . . ."\n"At the very start," they cried.\n". . . there was blackness . . ."\n"Preach it . . ."\n". . . and the sun . . ."\n"The sun, Lawd . . ."\n". . . was bloody red . . ."\n"Red . . ."\n"Now black is . . ." the preacher shouted.\n"Bloody . . ."\n"I said black is . . ."\n"Preach it, brother . . ."\n". . . an\' black ain\'t . . "\n"Red, Lawd, red: He said it\'s red!"\n"Amen, brother . . ."\n"Black will git you . . ."\n"Yes, it will . . ."\n". . . an\' black won\'t . . ."\n"Naw, it won\'t!"\n"It do . . ."\n"It do, Lawd . . ."\n". . . an\' it don\'t."\n"Halleluiah . . ."\n". . . It\'ll put you, glory, glory, Oh my Lawd, in the WHALE\'S\nBELLY."\n"Preach it, dear brother . . ."\n". . . an\' make you tempt . . ."\n"Good God a-mighty!"\n"Old Aunt Nelly!"\n"Black will make you . . ."\n"Black . . ."\n". . . or black will un-make you."\n"Ain\'t it the truth, Lawd?"\nAnd at that point a voice of trombone timbre screamed at me, "Git\nout of, here, you fool! Is you ready to commit treason?"\nAnd I tore myself away, hearing the old singer of spirituals moaning,\n"Go curse your God, boy, and die."\nI stopped and questioned her, asked her what was wrong.\n"I dearly loved my master, son," she said.\n"You should have hated him," I said.\n"He gave me several sons," she said, "and because I loved my sons I\nlearned to love their father though I hated him too."\n"I too have become acquainted with ambivalence," I said. "That\'s why\nI\'m here."\n"What\'s that?"\n"Nothing, a word that doesn\'t explain it. Why do you moan?"\n"I moan this way \'cause he\'s dead," she said.\n"Then tell me, who is that laughing upstairs?"\n"Them\'s my sons. They glad."\n"Yes, I can understand that too," I said.\n"I laughs too, but I moans too. He promised to set us free but he\nnever could bring hisself to do it. Still I loved him . . ."\n"Loved him? You mean . . ."\n"Oh yes, but 1 loved something else even more."\n"What more?"\n"Freedom."\n"Freedom," I said. "Maybe freedom lies in hating."\n"Naw, son, it\'s in loving. I loved him and give him the poison and\nhe withered away like a frost-bit apple. Them boys woulda tore him to pieces\nwith they homemake knives."\n"A mistake was made somewhere," I said, "I\'m confused." And I\nwished to say other things, but the laughter upstairs became too loud and\nmoan-like for me and I tried to break out of it, but I couldn\'t. Just as I was\nleaving I felt an urgent desire to ask her what freedom was and went back.\nShe sat with her head in her hands, moaning softly; her leather-brown face\nwas filled with sadness.\n"Old woman, what is this freedom you love so well?" I asked around\na corner of my mind.\nShe looked surprised, then thoughtful, then baffled. "I done forgot,\nson. It\'s all mixed up. First I think it\'s one thing, then I think it\'s another. It\ngits my head to spinning. I guess now it ain\'t nothing but knowing how to\nsay what I got up in my head. But it\'s a hard job, son. Too much is done\nhappen to me in too short a time. Hit\'s like I have a fever. Ever\' time I\nstarts to walk my head gits to swirling and I falls down. Or if it ain\'t that,\nit\'s the boys; they gits to laughing and wants to kill up the white folks.\nThey\'s bitter, that\'s what they is . . ."\n"But what about freedom?"\n"Leave me \'lone, boy; my head aches!"\nI left her, feeling dizzy myself. I didn\'t get far.\nSuddenly one of the sons, a big fellow six feet tall, appeared out of\nnowhere and struck me with his fist.\n"What\'s the matter, man?" I cried.\n"You made Ma cry!"\n"But how?" I said, dodging a blow.\n"Askin\' her them questions, that\'s how. Git outa here and stay, and\nnext time you got questions like that, ask yourself!"\nHe held me in a grip like cold stone, his fingers fastening upon my\nwindpipe until I thought I would suffocate before he finally allowed me to go.\nI stumbled about dazed, the music beating hysterically in my ears. It was\ndark. My head cleared and I wandered down a dark narrow passage, thinking\nI heard his footsteps hurrying behind me. I was sore, and into my being had\ncome a profound craving for tranquillity, for peace and quiet, a state I felt I\ncould never achieve. For one thing, the trumpet was blaring and the rhythm\nwas too hectic. A tomtom beating like heart-thuds began drowning out the\ntrumpet, filling my ears. I longed for water and I heard it rushing through\nthe cold mains my fingers touched as I felt my way, but I couldn\'t stop to\nsearch because of the footsteps behind me.\n"Hey, Ras," I called. "Is it you, Destroyer? Rinehart?"\nNo answer, only the rhythmic footsteps behind me. Once I tried\ncrossing the road, but a speeding machine struck me, scraping the skin from\nmy leg as it roared past.\nThen somehow I came out of it, ascending hastily from this\nunderworld of sound to hear Louis Armstrong innocently asking,\nWhat did I do\nTo be so black\nAnd blue?\nAt first I was afraid; this familiar music had demanded action, the\nkind of which I was incapable, and yet had I lingered there beneath the\nsurface I might have attempted to act. Nevertheless, I know now that few\nreally listen to this music. I sat on the chair\'s edge in a soaking sweat, as\nthough each of my 1,369 bulbs had everyone become a klieg light in an\nindividual setting for a third degree with Ras and Rinehart in charge. It was\nexhausting -- as though I had held my breath continuously for an hour under\nthe terrifying serenity that comes from days of intense hunger. And yet, it\nwas a strangely satisfying experience for an invisible man to hear the silence\nof sound. I had discovered unrecognized compulsions of my being -- even\nthough I could not answer "yes" to their promptings. I haven\'t smoked a\nreefer since, however; not because they\'re illegal, but because to see around\ncorners is enough (that is not unusual when you are invisible). But to hear\naround them is too much; it inhibits action. And despite Brother Jack and all\nthat sad, lost period of the Brotherhood, I believe in nothing if not in action.\nPlease, a definition: A hibernation is a covert preparation for a more\novert action.\nBesides, the drug destroys one\'s sense of time completely. If that\nhappened, I might forget to dodge some bright morning and some cluck\nwould run me down with an orange and yellow street car, or a bilious bus!\nOr I might forget to leave my hole when the moment for action presents\nitself.\nMeanwhile I enjoy my life with the compliments of Monopolated\nLight & Power. Since you never recognize me even when in closest contact\nwith me, and since, no doubt, you\'ll hardly believe that I exist, it won\'t\nmatter if you know that I tapped a power line leading into the building and\nran it into my hole in the ground. Before that I lived in the darkness into\nwhich I was chased, but now I see. I\'ve illuminated the blackness of my\ninvisibility -- and vice versa. And so I play the invisible music of my\nisolation. The last statement doesn\'t seem just right, does it? But it is; you\nhear this music simply because music is heard and seldom seen, except by\nmusicians. Could this compulsion to put invisibility down in black and white\nbe thus an urge to make music of invisibility? But I am an orator, a rabble\nrouser -- Am? I was, and perhaps shall be again. Who knows? All sickness is\nnot unto death, neither is invisibility.\nI can hear you say, "What a horrible, irresponsible bastard!" And\nyou\'re right. I leap to agree with you. I am one of the most irresponsible\nbeings that ever lived. Irresponsibility is part of my invisibility; any way you\nface it, it is a denial. But to whom can I be responsible, and why should I\nbe, when you refuse to see me? And wait until I reveal how truly\nirresponsible I am. Responsibility rests upon recognition, and recognition is a\nform of agreement. Take the man whom I almost killed: Who was responsible\nfor that near murder -- I? I don\'t think so, and I refuse it. I won\'t buy it.\nYou can\'t give it to me. He bumped me, he insulted me. Shouldn\'t he, for his\nown personal safety, have recognized my hysteria, my "danger potential"? He,\nlet us say, was lost in a dream world. But didn\'t he control that dream world\n-- which, alas, is only too real! -- and didn\'t he rule me out of it? And if he\nhad yelled for a policeman, wouldn\'t I have been taken for the offending one?\nYes, yes, yes! Let me agree with you, I was the irresponsible one; for I\nshould have used my knife to protect the higher interests of society. Some\nday that kind of foolishness will cause us tragic trouble. All dreamers and\nsleepwalkers must pay the price, and even the invisible victim is responsible\nfor the fate of all. But I shirked that responsibility; I became too snarled in\nthe incompatible notions that buzzed within my brain. I was a coward . . .\nBut what did I do to be so blue? Bear with me.\nChapter 1\nIt goes a long way back, some twenty years. All my life I had been\nlooking for something, and everywhere I turned someone tried to tell me\nwhat it was. I accepted their answers too, though they were often in\ncontradiction and even self-contradictory. I was na?e. I was looking for myself\nand asking everyone except myself questions which I, and only I, could\nanswer. It took me a long time and much painful boomeranging of my\nexpectations to achieve a realization everyone else appears to have been born\nwith: That I am nobody but myself. But first I had to discover that I am an\ninvisible man!\nAnd yet I am no freak of nature, nor of history. I was in the cards,\nother things having been equal (or unequal) eighty-five years ago. I am not\nashamed of my grandparents for having been slaves. I am only ashamed of\nmyself for having at one time been ashamed. About eighty-five years ago they\nwere told that they were free, united with others of our country in everything\npertaining to the common good, and, in everything social, separate like the\nfingers of the hand. And they believed it. They exulted in it. They stayed in\ntheir place, worked hard, and brought up my father to do the same. But my\ngrandfather is the one. He was an odd old guy, my grandfather, and I am\ntold I take after him. It was he who caused the trouble. On his deathbed he\ncalled my father to him and said, "Son, after I\'m gone I want you to keep up\nthe good fight. I never told you, but our life is a war and I have been a\ntraitor all my born days, a spy in the enemy\'s country ever since I give up\nmy gun back in the Reconstruction. Live with your head in the lion\'s mouth.\nI want you to overcome \'em with yeses, undermine \'em with grins, agree \'em\nto death and destruction, let \'em swoller you till they vomit or bust wide\nopen." They thought the old man had gone out of his mind. He had been the\nmeekest of men. The younger children were rushed from the room, the\nshades drawn and the flame of the lamp turned so low that it sputtered on\nthe wick like the old man\'s breathing. "Learn it to the younguns," he\nwhispered fiercely; then he died.\nBut my folks were more alarmed over his last words than over his\ndying. It was as though he had not died at all, his words caused so much\nanxiety. I was warned emphatically to forget what he had said and, indeed,\nthis is the first time it has been mentioned outside the family circle. It had a\ntremendous effect upon me, however. I could never be sure of what he\nmeant. Grandfather had been a quiet old man who never made any trouble,\nyet on his deathbed he had called himself a traitor and a spy, and he had\nspoken of his meekness as a dangerous activity. It became a constant puzzle\nwhich lay unanswered in the back of my mind. And whenever things went\nwell for me I remembered my grandfather and felt guilty and uncomfortable.\nIt was as though I was carrying out his advice in spite of myself. And to\nmake it worse, everyone loved me for it. I was praised by the most lily-white\nmen of the town. I was considered an example of desirable conduct -- just as\nmy grandfather had been. And what puzzled me was that the old man had\ndefined it as treachery. When I was praised for my conduct I felt a guilt that\nin some way I was doing something that was really against the wishes of the\nwhite folks, that if they had understood they would have desired me to act\njust the opposite, that I should have been sulky and mean, and that that\nreally would have been what they wanted, even though they were fooled and\nthought they wanted me to act as I did. It made me afraid that some day\nthey would look upon me as a traitor and I would be lost. Still I was more\nafraid to act any other way because they didn\'t like that at all. The old man\'s\nwords were like a curse. On my graduation day I delivered an oration in\nwhich I showed that humility was the secret, indeed, the very essence of\nprogress. (Not that I believed this -- how could I, remembering my\ngrandfather? -- I only believed that it worked.) It was a great success.\nEveryone praised me and I was invited to give the speech at a gathering of\nthe town\'s leading white citizens. It was a triumph for our whole community.\nIt was in the main ballroom of the leading hotel. When I got there I\ndiscovered that it was on the occasion of a smoker, and I was told that since\nI was to be there anyway I might as well take part in the battle royal to be\nfought by some of my schoolmates as part of the entertainment. The battle\nroyal came first.\nAll of the town\'s big shots were there in their tuxedoes, wolfing down\nthe buffet foods, drinking beer and whiskey and smoking black cigars. It was\na large room with a high ceiling. Chairs were arranged in neat rows around\nthree sides of a portable boxing ring. The fourth side was clear, revealing a\ngleaming space of polished floor. I had some misgivings over the battle royal,\nby the way. Not from a distaste for fighting, but because I didn\'t care too\nmuch for the other fellows who were to take part. They were tough guys who\nseemed to have no grandfather\'s curse worrying their minds. No one could\nmistake their toughness. And besides, I suspected that fighting a battle royal\nmight detract from the dignity of my speech. In those pre-invisible days I\nvisualized myself as a potential Booker T. Washington. But the other fellows\ndidn\'t care too much for me either, and there were nine of them. I felt\nsuperior to them in my way, and I didn\'t like the manner in which we were\nall crowded together into the servants\' elevator. Nor did they like my being\nthere. In fact, as the warmly lighted floors flashed past the elevator we had\nwords over the fact that I, by taking part in the fight, had knocked one of\ntheir friends out of a night\'s work.\nWe were led out of the elevator through a rococo hall into an\nanteroom and told to get into our fighting togs. Each of us was issued a pair\nof boxing gloves and ushered out into the big mirrored hall, which we\nentered looking cautiously about us and whispering, lest we might accidentally\nbe heard above the noise of the room. It was foggy with cigar smoke. And\nalready the whiskey was taking effect. I was shocked to see some of the most\nimportant men of the town quite tipsy. They were all there -- bankers,\nlawyers, judges, doctors, fire chiefs, teachers, merchants. Even one of the\nmore fashionable pastors. Something we could not see was going on up front.\nA clarinet was vibrating sensuously and the men were standing up and\nmoving eagerly forward. We were a small tight group, clustered together, our\nbare upper bodies touching and shining with anticipatory sweat; while up\nfront the big shots were becoming increasingly excited over something we still\ncould not see. Suddenly I heard the school superintendent, who had told me\nto come, yell, "Bring up the shines, gentlemen! Bring up the little shines!"\nWe were rushed up to the front of the ballroom, where it smelled\neven more strongly of tobacco and whiskey. Then we were pushed into place.\nI almost wet my pants. A sea of faces, some hostile, some amused, ringed\naround us, and in the center, facing us, stood a magnificent blonde -- stark\nnaked. There was dead silence. I felt a blast of cold air chill me. I tried to\nback away, but they were behind me and around me. Some of the boys stood\nwith lowered heads, trembling. I felt a wave of irrational guilt and fear. My\nteeth chattered, my skin turned to goose flesh, my knees knocked. Yet I was\nstrongly attracted and looked in spite of myself. Had the price of looking\nbeen blindness, I would have looked. The hair was yellow like that of a circus\nkewpie doll, the face heavily powdered and rouged, as though to form an\nabstract mask, the eyes hollow and smeared a cool blue, the color of a\nbaboon\'s butt. I felt a desire to spit upon her as my eyes brushed slowly over\nher body. Her breasts were firm and round as the domes of East Indian\ntemples, and I stood so close as to see the fine skin texture and beads of\npearly perspiration glistening like dew around the pink and erected buds of\nher nipples. I wanted at one and the same time to run from the room, to\nsink through the floor, or go to her and cover her from my eyes and the\neyes of the others with my body; to feel the soft thighs, to caress her and\ndestroy her, to love her and murder her, to hide from her, and yet to stroke\nwhere below the small American flag tattooed upon her belly her thighs\nformed a capital V. I had a notion that of all in the room she saw only me\nwith her impersonal eyes.\nAnd then she began to dance, a slow sensuous movement; the smoke\nof a hundred cigars clinging to her like the thinnest of veils. She seemed like\na fair bird-girl girdled in veils calling to me from the angry surface of some\ngray and threatening sea. I was transported. Then I became aware of the\nclarinet playing and the big shots yelling at us. Some threatened us if we\nlooked and others if we did not. On my right I saw one boy faint. And now\na man grabbed a silver pitcher from a table and stepped close as he dashed\nice water upon him and stood him up and forced two of us to support him\nas his head hung and moans issued from his thick bluish lips. Another boy\nbegan to plead to go home. He was the largest of the group, wearing dark\nred fighting trunks much too small to conceal the erection which projected\nfrom him as though in answer to the insinuating low-registered moaning of\nthe clarinet. He tried to hide himself with his boxing gloves.\nAnd all the while the blonde continued dancing, smiling faintly at the\nbig shots who watched her with fascination, and faintly smiling at our fear. I\nnoticed a certain merchant who followed her hungrily, his lips loose and\ndrooling. He was a large man who wore diamond studs in a shirtfront which\nswelled with the ample paunch underneath, and each time the blonde swayed\nher undulating hips he ran his hand through the thin hair of his bald head\nand, with his arms upheld, his posture clumsy like that of an intoxicated\npanda, wound his belly in a slow and obscene grind. This creature was\ncompletely hypnotized. The music had quickened. As the dancer flung herself\nabout with a detached expression on her face, the men began reaching out to\ntouch her. I could see their beefy fingers sink into the soft flesh. Some of the\nothers tried to stop them and she began to move around the floor in graceful\ncircles, as they gave chase, slipping and sliding over the polished floor. It was\nmad. Chairs went crashing, drinks were spilt, as they ran laughing and\nhowling after her. They caught her just as she reached a door, raised her\nfrom the floor, and tossed her as college boys are tossed at a hazing, and\nabove her red, fixed-smiling lips I saw the terror and disgust in her eyes,\nalmost like my own terror and that which I saw in some of the other boys.\nAs I watched, they tossed her twice and her soft breasts seemed to flatten\nagainst the air and her legs flung wildly as she spun. Some of the more\nsober ones helped her to escape. And I started off the floor, heading for the\nanteroom with the rest of the boys.\nSome were still crying and in hysteria. But as we tried to leave we\nwere stopped and ordered to get into the ring. There was nothing to do but\nwhat we were told. All ten of us climbed under the ropes and allowed\nourselves to be blindfolded with broad bands of white cloth. One of the men\nseemed to feel a bit sympathetic and tried to cheer us up as we stood with\nour backs against the ropes. Some of us tried to grin. "See that boy over\nthere?" one of the men said. "I want you to run across at the bell and give it\nto him right in the belly. If you don\'t get him, I\'m going to get you. I don\'t\nlike his looks." Each of us was told the same. The blindfolds were put on.\nYet even then I had been going over my speech. In my mind each word was\nas bright as flame. I felt the cloth pressed into place, and frowned so that it\nwould be loosened when I relaxed.\nBut now I felt a sudden fit of blind terror. I was unused to darkness.\nIt was as though I had suddenly found myself in a dark room filled with\npoisonous cottonmouths. I could hear the bleary voices yelling insistently for\nthe battle royal to begin.\n"Get going in there!"\n"Let me at that big nigger!"\nI strained to pick up the school superintendent\'s voice, as though to\nsqueeze some security out of that slightly more familiar sound.\n"Let me at those black sonsabitches!" someone yelled.\n"No, Jackson, no!" another voice yelled. "Here, somebody, help me\nhold Jack."\n"I want to get at that ginger-colored nigger. Tear him limb from\nlimb," the first voice yelled.\nI stood against the ropes trembling. For in those days I was what\nthey called ginger-colored, and he sounded as though he might crunch me\nbetween his teeth like a crisp ginger cookie.\nQuite a struggle was going on. Chairs were being kicked about and I\ncould hear voices grunting as with a terrific effort. I wanted to see, to see\nmore desperately than ever before. But the blindfold was as tight as a thick\nskin-puckering scab and when I raised my gloved hands to push the layers of\nwhite aside a voice yelled, "Oh, no you don\'t, black bastard! Leave that\nalone!"\n"Ring the bell before Jackson kills him a coon!" someone boomed in\nthe sudden silence. And I heard the bell clang and the sound of the feet\nscuffling forward.\nA glove smacked against my head. I pivoted, striking out stiffly as\nsomeone went past, and felt the jar ripple along the length of my arm to my\nshoulder. Then it seemed as though all nine of the boys had turned upon me\nat once. Blows pounded me from all sides while I struck out as best I could.\nSo many blows landed upon me that I wondered if I were not the only\nblindfolded fighter in the ring, or if the man called Jackson hadn\'t succeeded\nin getting me after all.\nBlindfolded, I could no longer control my motions. I had no dignity.\nI stumbled about like a baby or a drunken man. The smoke had become\nthicker and with each new blow it seemed to sear and further restrict my\nlungs. My saliva became like hot bitter glue. A glove connected with my head,\nfilling my mouth with warm blood. It was everywhere. I could not tell if the\nmoisture I felt upon my body was sweat or blood. A blow landed hard\nagainst the nape of my neck. I felt myself going over, my head hitting the\nfloor. Streaks of blue light filled the black world behind the blindfold. I lay\nprone, pretending that I was knocked out, but felt myself seized by hands\nand yanked to my feet. "Get going, black boy! Mix it up!" My arms were like\nlead, my head smarting from blows. I managed to feel my way to the ropes\nand held on, trying to catch my breath. A glove landed in my mid-section\nand I went over again, feeling as though the smoke had become a knife\njabbed into my guts. Pushed this way and that by the legs milling around\nme, I finally pulled erect and discovered that I could see the black,\nsweat-washed forms weaving in the smoky-blue atmosphere like drunken\ndancers weaving to the rapid drum-like thuds of blows.\nEveryone fought hysterically. It was complete anarchy. Everybody\nfought everybody else. No group fought together for long. Two, three, four,\nfought one, then turned to fight each other, were themselves attacked.\nBlows landed below the belt and in the kidney, with the gloves open as well\nas closed, and with my eye partly opened now there was not so much terror.\nI moved carefully, avoiding blows, although not too many to attract attention,\nfighting from group to group. The boys groped about like blind, cautious\ncrabs crouching to protect their mid-sections, their heads pulled in short\nagainst their shoulders, their arms stretched nervously before them, with their\nfists testing the smoke-filled air like the knobbed feelers of hypersensitive\nsnails. In one corner I glimpsed a boy violently punching the air and heard\nhim scream in pain as he smashed his hand against a ring post. For a\nsecond I saw him bent over holding his hand, then going down as a blow\ncaught his unprotected head. I played one group against the other, slipping in\nand throwing a punch then stepping out of range while pushing the others\ninto the melee to take the blows blindly aimed at me. The smoke was\nagonizing and there were no rounds, no bells at three minute intervals to\nrelieve our exhaustion. The room spun round me, a swirl of lights, smoke,\nsweating bodies surrounded by tense white faces. I bled from both nose and\nmouth, the blood spattering upon my chest.\nThe men kept yelling, "Slug him, black boy! Knock his guts out!"\n"Uppercut him! Kill him! Kill that big boy!"\nTaking a fake fall, I saw a boy going down heavily beside me as\nthough we were felled by a single blow, saw a sneaker-clad foot shoot into\nhis groin as the two who had knocked him down stumbled upon him. I\nrolled out of range, feeling a twinge of nausea.\nThe harder we fought the more threatening the men became. And\nyet, I had begun to worry about my speech again. How would it go? Would\nthey recognize my ability? What would they give me?\nI was fighting automatically when suddenly I noticed that one after\nanother of the boys was leaving the ring. I was surprised, filled with panic, as\nthough I had been left alone with an unknown danger. Then I understood.\nThe boys had arranged it among themselves. It was the custom for the two\nmen left in the ring to slug it out for the winner\'s prize. I discovered this too\nlate. When the bell sounded two men in tuxedoes leaped into the ring and\nremoved the blindfold. I found myself facing Tatlock, the biggest of the gang.\nI felt sick at my stomach. Hardly had the bell stopped ringing in my ears\nthan it clanged again and I saw him moving swiftly toward me. Thinking of\nnothing else to do I hit him smash on the nose. He kept coming, bringing\nthe rank sharp violence of stale sweat. His face was a black blank of a face,\nonly his eyes alive -- with hate of me and aglow with a feverish terror from\nwhat had happened to us all. I became anxious. I wanted to deliver my\nspeech and he came at me as though he meant to beat it out of me. I\nsmashed him again and again, taking his blows as they came. Then on a\nsudden impulse I struck him lightly and as we clinched, I whispered, "Fake\nlike I knocked you out, you can have the prize."\n"I\'ll break your behind," he whispered hoarsely.\n"For them?"\n"For me, sonofabitch!"\nThey were yelling for us to break it up and Tatlock spun me half\naround with a blow, and as a joggled camera sweeps in a reeling scene, I\nsaw the howling red faces crouching tense beneath the cloud of blue-gray\nsmoke. For a moment the world wavered, unraveled, flowed, then my head\ncleared and Tatlock bounced before me. That fluttering shadow before my\neyes was his jabbing left hand. Then falling forward, my head against his\ndamp shoulder, I whispered,\n"I\'ll make it five dollars more."\n"Go to hell!"\nBut his muscles relaxed a trifle beneath my pressure and I breathed,\n"Seven?"\n"Give it to your ma," he said, ripping me beneath the heart.\nAnd while I still held him I butted him and moved away. I felt\nmyself bombarded with punches. I fought back with hopeless desperation. I\nwanted to deliver my speech more than anything else in the world, felt that\nonly these men could judge truly my ability, and now this stupid clown was\nruining my chances. I began fighting carefully now, moving in to punch him\nand out again with my greater speed. A lucky blow to his chin and I had\nhim going too -- until I heard a loud voice yell, "I got my money on the big\nboy."\nHearing this, I almost dropped my guard. I was confused: Should I\ntry to win against the voice out there? Would not this go against my speech,\nand was not this a moment for humility, for nonresistance? A blow to my\nhead as I danced about sent my right eye popping like a jack-in-the-box and\nsettled my dilemma. The room went red as I fell. It was a dream fall, my\nbody languid and fastidious as to where to land, until the floor became\nimpatient and smashed up to meet me. A moment later I came to. An\nhypnotic voice said FIVE emphatically. And I lay there, hazily watching a\ndark red spot of my own blood shaping itself into a butterfly, glistening and\nsoaking into the soiled gray world of the canvas.\nWhen the voice drawled TEN I was lifted up and dragged to a chair.\nI sat dazed. My eye pained and swelled with each throb of my pounding\nheart and I wondered if now I would be allowed to speak. I was wringing\nwet, my mouth still bleeding. We were grouped along the wall now. The other\nboys ignored me as they congratulated Tatlock and speculated as to how\nmuch they would be paid. One boy whimpered over his smashed hand.\nLooking up front, I saw attendants in white jackets rolling the portable ring\naway and placing a small square rug in the vacant space surrounded by\nchairs. Perhaps, I thought, I will stand on the rug to deliver my speech.\nThen the M.C. called to us, "Come on up here boys and get your\nmoney."\nWe ran forward to where the men laughed and talked in their chairs,\nwaiting. Everyone seemed friendly now.\n"There it is on the rug," the man said. I saw the rug covered with\ncoins of all dimensions and a few crumpled bills. But what excited me,\nscattered here and there, were the gold pieces.\n"Boys, it\'s all yours," the man said. "You get all you grab."\n"That\'s right, Sambo," a blond man said, winking at me\nconfidentially.\nI trembled with excitement, forgetting my pain. I would get the gold\nand the bills, I thought. I would use both hands. I would throw my body\nagainst the boys nearest me to block them from the gold.\n"Get down around the rug now," the man commanded, "and don\'t\nanyone touch it until I give the signal."\n"This ought to be good," I heard.\nAs told, we got around the square rug on our knees. Slowly the man\nraised his freckled hand as we followed it upward with our eyes.\nI heard, "These niggers look like they\'re about to pray!"\nThen, "Ready," the man said. "Go!"\nI lunged for a yellow coin lying on the blue design of the carpet,\ntouching it and sending a surprised shriek to join those rising around me. I\ntried frantically to remove my hand but could not let go. A hot, violent force\ntore through my body, shaking me like a wet rat. The rug was electrified. The\nhair bristled up on my head as I shook myself free. My muscles jumped, my\nnerves jangled, writhed. But I saw that this was not stopping the other boys.\nLaughing in fear and embarrassment, some were holding back and scooping\nup the coins knocked off by the painful contortions of the others. The men\nroared above us as we struggled.\n"Pick it up, goddamnit, pick it up!" someone called like a bass-voiced\nparrot. "Go on, get it!"\nI crawled rapidly around the floor, picking up the coins, trying to\navoid the coppers and to get greenbacks and the gold. Ignoring the shock by\nlaughing, as I brushed the coins off quickly, I discovered that I could contain\nthe electricity -- a contradiction, but it works. Then the men began to push\nus onto the rug. Laughing embarrassedly, we struggled out of their hands and\nkept after the coins. We were all wet and slippery and hard to hold.\nSuddenly I saw a boy lifted into the air, glistening with sweat like a circus\nseal, and dropped, his wet back landing flush upon the charged rug, heard\nhim yell and saw him literally dance upon his back, elbows beating a frenzied\ntattoo upon the floor, his muscles twitching like the flesh of a horse stung\nmy many flies. When he finally rolled off, his face was gray and no one\nstopped him when he ran from the floor amid booming laughter.\n"Get the money," the M.C. called. "That\'s good hard American cash!"\nAnd we snatched and grabbed, snatched and grabbed. I was careful\nnot to come too close to the rug now, and when I felt the hot whiskey\nbreath descend upon me like a cloud of foul air I reached out and grabbed\nthe leg of a chair. It was occupied and I held on desperately.\n"Leggo, nigger! Leggo!"\nThe huge face wavered down to mine as he tried to push me free.\nBut my body was slippery and he was too drunk. It was Mr. Colcord, who\nowned a chain of movie houses and "entertainment palaces." Each time he\ngrabbed me I slipped out of his hands. It became a real struggle. I feared the\nrug more than I did the drunk, so I held on, surprising myself for a moment\nby trying to topple him upon the rug. It was such an enormous idea that I\nfound myself actually carrying it out. I tried not to be obvious, yet when I\ngrabbed his leg, trying to tumble him out of the chair, he raised up roaring\nwith laughter, and, looking at me with soberness dead in the eye, kicked me\nviciously in the chest. The chair leg flew out of my hand and I felt myself\ngoing and rolled. It was as though I had rolled through a bed of hot coals. It\nseemed a whole century would pass before I would roll free, a century in\nwhich I was seared through the deepest levels of my body to the fearful\nbreath within me and the breath seared and heated to the point of explosion.\nIt\'ll all be over in a flash, I thought as I rolled clear. It\'ll all be over in a\nflash.\nBut not yet, the men on the other side were waiting, red faces\nswollen as though from apoplexy as they bent forward in their chairs. Seeing\ntheir fingers coming toward me I rolled away as a fumbled football rolls off\nthe receiver\'s fingertips, back into the coals. That time I luckily sent the rug\nsliding out of place and heard the coins ringing against the floor and the\nboys scuffling to pick them up and the M.C. calling, "All right, boys, that\'s\nall. Go get dressed and get your money."\nI was limp as a dish rag. My back felt as though it had been beaten\nwith wires.\nWhen we had dressed the M.C. came in and gave us each five\ndollars, except Tatlock, who got ten for being last in the ring. Then he told\nus to leave. I was not to get a chance to deliver my speech, I thought. I was\ngoing out into the dim alley in despair when I was stopped and told to go\nback. I returned to the ballroom, where the men were pushing back their\nchairs and gathering in groups to talk.\nThe M.C. knocked on a table for quiet. "Gentlemen," he said, "we\nalmost forgot an important part of the program. A most serious part,\ngentlemen. This boy was brought here to deliver a speech which he made at\nhis graduation yesterday . . ."\n"Bravo!"\n"I\'m told that he is the smartest boy we\'ve got out there in\nGreenwood. I\'m told that he knows more big words than a pocket-sized\ndictionary."\nMuch applause and laughter.\n"So now, gentlemen, I want you to give him your attention."\nThere was still laughter as I faced them, my mouth dry, my eye\nthrobbing. I began slowly, but evidently my throat was tense, because they\nbegan shouting, "Louder! Louder!"\n"We of the younger generation extol the wisdom of that great leader\nand educator," I shouted, "who first spoke these flaming words of wisdom: \'A\nship lost at sea for many days suddenly sighted a friendly vessel. From the\nmast of the unfortunate vessel was seen a signal: "Water, water; we die of\nthirst!" The answer from the friendly vessel came back: "Cast down your\nbucket where you are." The captain of the distressed vessel, at last heeding\nthe injunction, cast down his bucket, and it came up full of fresh sparkling\nwater from the mouth of the Amazon River.\' And like him I say, and in his\nwords, \'To those of my race who depend upon bettering their condition in a\nforeign land, or who underestimate the importance of cultivating friendly\nrelations with the Southern white man, who is his next-door neighbor, I\nwould say: "Cast down your bucket where you are" -- cast it down in making\nfriends in every manly way of the people of all races by whom we are\nsurrounded . . .\' "\nI spoke automatically and with such fervor that I did not realize that\nthe men were still talking and laughing until my dry mouth, filling up with\nblood from the cut, almost strangled me. I coughed, wanting to stop and go\nto one of the tall brass, sand-filled spittoons to relieve myself, but a few of\nthe men, especially the superintendent, were listening and I was afraid. So I\ngulped it down, blood, saliva and all, and continued. (What powers of\nendurance I had during those days! What enthusiasm! What a belief in the\nrightness of things!) I spoke even louder in spite of the pain. But still they\ntalked and still they laughed, as though deaf with cotton in dirty ears. So I\nspoke with greater emotional emphasis. I closed my ears and swallowed blood\nuntil I was nauseated. The speech seemed a hundred times as long as before,\nbut I could not leave out a single word. All had to be said, each memorized\nnuance considered, rendered. Nor was that all. Whenever I uttered a word of\nthree or more syllables a group of voices would yell for me to repeat it. I\nused the phrase "social responsibility" and they yelled:\n"What\'s that word you say, boy?"\n"Social responsibility," I said.\n"What?"\n"Social . . ."\n"Louder."\n". . . responsibility."\n"More!"\n"Respon --"\n"Repeat!"\n"-- sibility."\nThe room filled with the uproar of laughter until, no doubt,\ndistracted by having to gulp down my blood, I made a mistake and yelled a\nphrase I had often seen denounced in newspaper editorials, heard debated in\nprivate.\n"Social . . ."\n"What?" they yelled.\n". . . equality --"\nThe laughter hung smokelike in the sudden stillness. I opened my\neyes, puzzled. Sounds of displeasure filled the room. The M.C. rushed forward.\nThey shouted hostile phrases at me. But I did not understand.\nA small dry mustached man in the front row blared out, "Say that\nslowly, son!"\n"What sir?"\n"What you just said!"\n"Social responsibility, sir," I said.\n"You weren\'t being smart, were you, boy?" he said, not unkindly.\n"No, sir!"\n"You sure that about \'equality\' was a mistake?"\n"Oh, yes, sir," I said. "I was swallowing blood."\n"Well, you had better speak more slowly so we can understand. We\nmean to do right by you, but you\'ve got to know your place at all times. All\nright, now, go on with your speech."\nI was afraid. I wanted to leave but I wanted also to speak and I was\nafraid they\'d snatch me down.\n"Thank you, sir," I said, beginning where I had left off, and having\nthem ignore me as before.\nYet when I finished there was a thunderous applause. I was surprised\nto see the superintendent come forth with a package wrapped in white tissue\npaper, and, gesturing for quiet, address the men.\n"Gentlemen, you see that I did not overpraise this boy. He makes a\ngood speech and some day he\'ll lead his people in the proper paths. And I\ndon\'t have to tell you that that is important in these days and times. This is\na good, smart boy, and so to encourage him in the right direction, in the\nname of the Board of Education I wish to present him a prize in the form of\nthis . . ."\nHe paused, removing the tissue paper and revealing a gleaming\ncalfskin brief case.\n". . . in the form of this first-class article from Shad Whitmore\'s\nshop."\n"Boy," he said, addressing me, "take this prize and keep it well.\nConsider it a badge of office. Prize it. Keep developing as you are and some\nday it will be filled with important papers that will help shape the destiny of\nyour people."\nI was so moved that I could hardly express my thanks. A rope of\nbloody saliva forming a shape like an undiscovered continent drooled upon\nthe leather and I wiped it quickly away. I felt an importance that I had never\ndreamed.\n"Open it and see what\'s inside," I was told.\nMy fingers a-tremble, I complied, smelling the fresh leather and\nfinding an official-looking document inside. It was a scholarship to the state\ncollege for Negroes. My eyes filled with tears and I ran awkwardly off the\nfloor.\nI was overjoyed; I did not even mind when I discovered that the\ngold pieces I had scrambled for were brass pocket tokens advertising a certain\nmake of automobile.\nWhen I reached home everyone was excited. Next day the neighbors\ncame to congratulate me. I even felt safe from grandfather, whose deathbed\ncurse usually spoiled my triumphs. I stood beneath his photograph with my\nbrief case in hand and smiled triumphantly into his stolid black peasant\'s\nface. It was a face that fascinated me. The eyes seemed to follow everywhere\nI went.\nThat night I dreamed I was at a circus with him and that he refused\nto laugh at the clowns no matter what they did. Then later he told me to\nopen my brief case and read what was inside and I did, finding an official\nenvelope stamped with the state seal; and inside the envelope I found another\nand another, endlessly, and I thought I would fall of weariness. "Them\'s\nyears," he said. "Now open that one." And I did and in it I found an\nengraved document containing a short message in letters of gold. "Read it,"\nmy grandfather said. "Out loud."\n"To Whom It May Concern," I intoned. "Keep This Nigger-Boy\nRunning."\nI awoke with the old man\'s laughter ringing in my ears.\n(It was a dream I was to remember and dream again for many years\nafter. But at that time I had no insight into its meaning. First I had to\nattend college.)\nChapter 2\nIt was a beautiful college. The buildings were old and covered with\nvines and the roads gracefully winding, lined with hedges and wild roses that\ndazzled the eyes in the summer sun. Honeysuckle and purple wisteria hung\nheavy from the trees and white magnolias mixed with their scents in the\nbee-humming air. I\'ve recalled it often, here in my hole: How the grass\nturned green in the springtime and how the mocking birds fluttered their tails\nand sang, how the moon shone down on the buildings, how the bell in the\nchapel tower rang out the precious short-lived hours; how the girls in bright\nsummer dresses promenaded the grassy lawn. Many times, here at night, I\'ve\nclosed my eyes and walked along the forbidden road that winds past the girls\'\ndormitories, past the hall with the clock in the tower, its windows warmly\naglow, on down past the small white Home Economics practice cottage, whiter\nstill in the moonlight, and on down the road with its sloping and turning,\nparalleling the black powerhouse with its engines droning earth-shaking\nrhythms in the dark, its windows red from the glow of the furnace, on to\nwhere the road became a bridge over a dry riverbed, tangled with brush and\nclinging vines; the bridge of rustic logs, made for trysting, but virginal and\nuntested by lovers; on up the road, past the buildings, with the southern\nverandas half-a-city-block long, to the sudden forking, barren of buildings,\nbirds, or grass, where the road turned off to the insane asylum.\nI always come this far and open my eyes. The spell breaks and I try\nto re-see the rabbits, so tame through having never been hunted, that played\nin the hedges and along the road. And I see the purple and silver of thistle\ngrowing between the broken glass and sunheated stones, the ants moving\nnervously in single file, and I turn and retrace my steps and come back to\nthe winding road past the hospital, where at night in certain wards the gay\nstudent nurses dispensed a far more precious thing than pills to lucky boys in\nthe know; and I come to a stop at the chapel. And then it is suddenly\nwinter, with the moon high above and the chimes in the steeple ringing and\na sonorous choir of trombones rendering a Christmas carol; and over all is a\nquietness and an ache as though all the world were loneliness. And I stand\nand listen beneath the high-hung moon, hearing "A Mighty Fortress Is Our\nGod," majestically mellow on four trombones, and then the organ. The sound\nfloats over all, clear like the night, liquid, serene, and lonely. And I stand as\nfor an answer and see in my mind\'s eye the cabins surrounded by empty\nfields beyond red clay roads, and beyond a certain road a river, sluggish and\ncovered with algae more yellow than green in its stagnant stillness; past more\nempty fields, to the sun-shrunk shacks at the railroad crossing where the\ndisabled veterans visited the whores, hobbling down the tracks on crutches\nand canes; sometimes pushing the legless, thighless one in a red wheelchair.\nAnd sometimes I listen to hear if music reaches that far, but recall only the\ndrunken laughter of sad, sad whores. And I stand in the circle where three\nroads converge near the statue, where we drilled four-abreast down the\nsmooth asphalt and pivoted and entered the chapel on Sundays, our uniforms\npressed, shoes shined, minds laced up, eyes blind like those of robots to\nvisitors and officials on the low, whitewashed reviewing stand.\nIt\'s so long ago and far away that here in my invisibility I wonder if\nit happened at all. Then in my mind\'s eye I see the bronze statue of the\ncollege Founder, the cold Father symbol, his hands outstretched in the\nbreathtaking gesture of lifting a veil that flutters in hard, metallic folds above\nthe face of a kneeling slave; and I am standing puzzled, unable to decide\nwhether the veil is really being lifted, or lowered more firmly in place;\nwhether I am witnessing a revelation or a more efficient blinding. And as I\ngaze, there is a rustle of wings and I see a flock of starlings flighting before\nme and, when I look again, the bronze face, whose empty eyes look upon a\nworld I have never seen, runs with liquid chalk -- creating another ambiguity\nto puzzle my groping mind: Why is a bird-soiled statue more commanding\nthan one that is clean?\nOh, long green stretch of campus, Oh, quiet songs at dusk, Oh, moon\nthat kissed the steeple and flooded the perfumed nights, Oh, bugle that called\nin the morning, Oh, drum that marched us militarily at noon -- what was\nreal, what solid, what more than a pleasant, time-killing dream? For how\ncould it have been real if now I am invisible? If real, why is it that I can\nrecall in all that island of greenness no fountain but one that was broken,\ncorroded and dry? And why does no rain fall through my recollections, sound\nthrough my memories, soak through the hard dry crust of the still so recent\npast? Why do I recall, instead of the odor of seed bursting in springtime,\nonly the yellow contents of the cistern spread over the lawn\'s dead grass?\nWhy? And how? How and why?\nThe grass did grow and the green leaves appeared on the trees and\nfilled the avenues with shadow and shade as sure as the millionaires\ndescended from the North on Founders\' Day each spring. And how they\narrived! Came smiling, inspecting, encouraging, conversing in whispers,\nspeechmaking into the wide-open ears of our black and yellow faces -- and\neach leaving a sizeable check as he departed. I\'m convinced it was the\nproduct of a subtle magic, the alchemy of moonlight; the school a\nflower-studded wasteland, the rocks sunken, the dry winds hidden, the lost\ncrickets chirping to yellow butterflies.\nAnd oh, oh, oh, those multimillionaires!\nTHEY were all such a part of that other life that\'s dead that I can\'t\nremember them all. (Time was as I was, but neither that time nor that "I"\nare any more.) But this one I remember: near the end of my junior year I\ndrove for him during the week he was on the campus. A face pink like St.\nNicholas\', topped with a shock of silk white hair. An easy, informal manner,\neven with me. A Bostonian, smoker of cigars, teller of polite Negro stories,\nshrewd banker, skilled scientist, director, philanthropist, forty years a bearer\nof the white man\'s burden, and for sixty a symbol of the Great Traditions.\nWe were driving, the powerful motor purring and filling me with\npride and anxiety. The car smelled of mints and cigar smoke. Students looked\nup and smiled in recognition as we rolled slowly past. I had just come from\ndinner and in bending forward to suppress a belch, I accidentally pressed the\nbutton on the wheel and the belch became a loud and shattering blast of the\nhorn. Folks on the road turned and stared.\n"I\'m awfully sorry, sir," I said, worried lest he report me to Dr.\nBledsoe, the president, who would refuse to allow me to drive again.\n"Perfectly all right. Perfectly."\n"Where shall I drive you, sir?"\n"Let me see . . ."\nThrough the rear-view mirror I could see him studying a wafer-thin\nwatch, replacing it in the pocket of his checked waistcoat. His shirt was soft\nsilk, set off with a blue-and-white polka-dotted bow tie. His manner was\naristocratic, his movements dapper and suave.\n"It\'s early to go in for the next session," he said. "Suppose you just\ndrive. Anywhere you like."\n"Have you seen all the campus, sir?"\n"Yes, I think so. I was one of the original founders, you know."\n"Gee! I didn\'t know that, sir. Then I\'ll have to try some of the\nroads."\nOf course I knew he was a founder, but I knew also that it was\nadvantageous to flatter rich white folks. Perhaps he\'d give me a large tip, or\na suit, or a scholarship next year.\n"Anywhere else you like. The campus is part of my life and I know\nmy life rather well."\n"Yes, sir."\nHe was still smiling.\nIn a moment the green campus with its vine-covered buildings was\nbehind us. The car bounded over the road. How was the campus part of his\nlife, I wondered. And how did one learn his life "rather well"?\n"Young man, you\'re part of a wonderful institution. It is a great\ndream become reality . . ."\n"Yes, sir," I said.\n"I feel as lucky to be connected with it as you no doubt do yourself.\nI came here years ago, when all your beautiful campus was barren ground.\nThere were no trees, no flowers, no fertile farmland. That was years ago\nbefore you were born . . ."\nI listened with fascination, my eyes glued to the white line dividing\nthe highway as my thoughts attempted to sweep back to the times of which\nhe spoke.\n"Even your parents were young. Slavery was just recently past. Your\npeople did not know in what direction to turn and, I must confess, many of\nmine didn\'t know in what direction they should turn either. But your great\nFounder did. He was my friend and I believed in his vision. So much so,\nthat sometimes I don\'t know whether it was his vision or mine . . ."\nHe chuckled softly, wrinkles forming at the corners of his eyes.\n"But of course it was his; I only assisted. I came down with him to\nsee the barren land and did what I could to render assistance. And it has\nbeen my pleasant fate to return each spring and observe the changes that the\nyears have wrought. That has been more pleasant and satisfying to me than\nmy own work. It has been a pleasant fate, indeed."\nHis voice was mellow and loaded with more meaning than I could\nfathom. As I drove, faded and yellowed pictures of the school\'s early days\ndisplayed in the library flashed across the screen of my mind, coming fitfully\nand fragmentarily to life -- photographs of men and women in wagons drawn\nby mule teams and oxen, dressed in black, dusty clothing, people who seemed\nalmost without individuality, a black mob that seemed to be waiting, looking\nwith blank faces, and among them the inevitable collection of white men and\nwomen in smiles, clear of features, striking, elegant and confident. Until now,\nand although I could recognize the Founder and Dr. Bledsoe among them, the\nfigures in the photographs had never seemed actually to have been alive, but\nwere more like signs or symbols one found on the last pages of the\ndictionary . . . But now I felt that I was sharing in a great work and, with\nthe car leaping leisurely beneath the pressure of my foot, I identified myself\nwith the rich man reminiscing on the rear seat . . .\n"A pleasant fate," he repeated, "and I hope yours will be as pleasant."\n"Yes, sir. Thank you, sir," I said, pleased that he wished something\npleasant for me.\nBut at the same time I was puzzled: How could anyone\'s fate be\npleasant? I had always thought of it as something painful. No one I knew\nspoke of it as pleasant -- not even Woodridge, who made us read Greek\nplays.\nWe were beyond the farthest extension of the school-owned lands\nnow and I suddenly decided to turn off the highway, down a road that\nseemed unfamiliar. There were no trees and the air was brilliant. Far down\nthe road the sun glared cruelly against a tin sign nailed to a barn. A lone\nfigure bending over a hoe on the hillside raised up wearily and waved, more\na shadow against the skyline than a man.\n"How far have we come?" I heard over my shoulder.\n"Just about a mile, sir."\n"I don\'t remember this section," he said.\nI didn\'t answer. I was thinking of the first person who\'d mentioned\nanything like fate in my presence, my grandfather. There had been nothing\npleasant about it and I had tried to forget it. Now, riding here in the\npowerful car with this white man who was so pleased with what he called his\nfate, I felt a sense of dread. My grandfather would have called this treachery\nand I could not understand in just what way it was. Suddenly I grew guilty\nat the realization that the white man might have thought so too. What would\nhe have thought? Did he know that Negroes like my grandfather had been\nfreed during those days just before the college had been founded?\nAs we came to a side road I saw a team of oxen hitched to a\nbroken-down wagon, the ragged driver dozing on the seat beneath the shade\nof a clump of trees.\n"Did you see that, sir?" I asked over my shoulder.\n"What was it?"\n"The ox team, sir."\n"Oh! No, I can\'t see it for the trees," he said looking back. "It\'s good\ntimber."\n"I\'m sorry, sir. Shall I turn back?"\n"No, it isn\'t much," he said. "Go on."\nI drove on, remembering the lean, hungry face of the sleeping man.\nHe was the kind of white man I feared. The brown fields swept out to the\nhorizon. A flock of birds dipped down, circled, swung up and out as though\nlinked by invisible strings. Waves of heat danced above the engine hood. The\ntires sang over the highway. Finally I overcame my timidity and asked him:\n"Sir, why did you become interested in the school?"\n"I think," he said, thoughtfully, raising his voice, "it was because I\nfelt even as a young man that your people were somehow closely connected\nwith my destiny. Do you understand?"\n"Not so clearly, sir," I said, ashamed to admit it.\n"You have studied Emerson, haven\'t you?"\n"Emerson, sir?"\n"Ralph Waldo Emerson."\nI was embarrassed because I hadn\'t. "Not yet, sir. We haven\'t come\nto him yet."\n"No?" he said with a note of surprise. "Well, never mind. I am a\nNew Englander, like Emerson. You must learn about him, for he was\nimportant to your people. He had a hand in your destiny. Yes, perhaps that\nis what I mean. I had a feeling that your people were somehow connected\nwith my destiny. That what happened to you was connected with what would\nhappen to me . . ."\nI slowed the car, trying to understand. Through the glass I saw him\ngazing at the long ash of his cigar, holding it delicately in his slender,\nmanicured fingers.\n"Yes, you are my fate, young man. Only you can tell me what it\nreally is. Do you understand?"\n"I think I do, sir."\n"I mean that upon you depends the outcome of the years I have\nspent in helping your school. That has been my life\'s work, not my banking\nor my researches, but my first-hand organizing of human life."\nI saw him now, leaning toward the front seat, speaking with an\nintensity which had not been there before. It was hard not to turn my eyes\nfrom the highway and face him.\n"There is another reason, a reason more important, more passionate\nand, yes, even more sacred than all the others," he said, no longer seeming\nto see me, but speaking to himself alone. "Yes, even more sacred than all the\nothers. A girl, my daughter. She was a being more rare, more beautiful,\npurer, more perfect and more delicate than the wildest dream of a poet. I\ncould never believe her to be my own flesh and blood. Her beauty was a\nwell-spring of purest water-of-life, and to look upon her was to drink and\ndrink and drink again . . . She was rare, a perfect creation, a work of purest\nart. A delicate flower that bloomed in the liquid light of the moon. A nature\nnot of this world, a personality like that of some biblical maiden, gracious\nand queenly. I found it difficult to believe her my own . . ."\nSuddenly he fumbled in his vest pocket and thrust something over\nthe back of the seat, surprising me.\n"Here, young man, you owe much of your good fortune in attending\nsuch a school to her."\nI looked upon the tinted miniature framed in engraved platinum. I\nalmost dropped it. A young woman of delicate, dreamy features looked up at\nme. She was very beautiful, I thought at the time, so beautiful that I did not\nknow whether I should express admiration to the extent I felt it or merely\nact polite. And yet I seemed to remember her, or someone like her, in the\npast. I know now that it was the flowing costume of soft, flimsy material that\nmade for the effect; today, dressed in one of the smart, well-tailored, angular,\nsterile, streamlined, engine-turned, air-conditioned modern outfits you see in\nthe women\'s magazines, she would appear as ordinary as an expensive piece\nof machine-tooled jewelry and just as lifeless. Then, however, I shared\nsomething of his enthusiasm.\n"She was too pure for life," he said sadly; "too pure and too good\nand too beautiful. We were sailing together, touring the world, just she and I,\nwhen she became ill in Italy. I thought little of it at the time and we\ncontinued across the Alps. When we reached Munich she was already fading\naway. While we were attending an embassy party she collapsed. The best\nmedical science in the world could not save her. It was a lonely return, a\nbitter voyage. I have never recovered. I have never forgiven myself. Everything\nI\'ve done since her passing has been a monument to her memory."\nHe became silent, looking with his blue eyes far beyond the field\nstretching away in the sun. I returned the miniature, wondering what in the\nworld had made him open his heart to me. That was something I never did;\nit was dangerous. First, it was dangerous if you felt like that about anything,\nbecause then you\'d never get it or something or someone would take it away\nfrom you; then it was dangerous because nobody would understand you and\nthey\'d only laugh and think you were crazy.\n"So you see, young man, you are involved in my life quite intimately,\neven though you\'ve never seen me before. You are bound to a great dream\nand to a beautiful monument. If you become a good farmer, a chef, a\npreacher, doctor, singer, mechanic -- whatever you become, and even if you\nfail, you are my fate. And you must write me and tell me the outcome."\nI was relieved to see him smiling through the mirror. My feelings\nwere mixed. Was he kidding me? Was he talking to me like someone in a\nbook just to see how I would take it? Or could it be, I was almost afraid to\nthink, that this rich man was just the tiniest bit crazy? How could I tell him\nhis fate? He raised his head and our eyes met for an instant in the glass,\nthen I lowered mine to the blazing white line that divided the highway.\nThe trees along the road were thick and tall. We took a curve. Flocks\nof quail sailed up and over a field, brown, brown, sailing down, blending.\n"Will you promise to tell me my fate?" I heard.\n"Sir?"\n"Will you?"\n"Right now, sir?" I asked with embarrassment.\n"It is up to you. Now, if you like."\nI was silent. His voice was serious, demanding. I could think of no\nreply. The motor purred. An insect crushed itself against the windshield,\nleaving a yellow, mucous smear.\n"I don\'t know now, sir. This is only my junior year . . ."\n"But you\'ll tell me when you know?"\n"I\'ll try, sir."\n"Good."\nWhen I took a quick glance into the mirror he was smiling again. I\nwanted to ask him if being rich and famous and helping to direct the school\nto become what it was, wasn\'t enough; but I was afraid.\n"What do you think of my idea, young man?" he said.\n"I don\'t know, sir. I only think that you have what you\'re looking\nfor. Because if I fail or leave school, it doesn\'t seem to me it would be your\nfault. Because you helped make the school what it is."\n"And you think that enough?"\n"Yes, sir. That\'s what the president tells us. You have yours, and you\ngot it yourself, and we have to lift ourselves up the same way."\n"But that\'s only part of it, young man. I have wealth and a\nreputation and prestige -- all that is true. But your great Founder had more\nthan that, he had tens of thousands of lives dependent upon his ideas and\nupon his actions. What he did affected your whole race. In a way, he had the\npower of a king, or in a sense, of a god. That, I\'ve come to believe, is more\nimportant than my own work, because more depends upon you. You are\nimportant because if you fail I have failed by one individual, one defective\ncog; it didn\'t matter so much before, but now I\'m growing old and it has\nbecome very important . . ."\nBut you don\'t even know my name, I thought, wondering what it was\nall about.\n". . . I suppose it is difficult for you to understand how this concerns\nme. But as you develop you must remember that I am dependent upon you\nto learn my fate. Through you and your fellow students I become, let us say,\nthree hundred teachers, seven hundred trained mechanics, eight hundred\nskilled farmers, and so on. That way I can observe in terms of living\npersonalities to what extent my money, my time and my hopes have been\nfruitfully invested. I also construct a living memorial to my daughter.\nUnderstand? I can see the fruits produced by the land that your great\nFounder has transformed from barren clay to fertile soil."\nHis voice ceased and I saw the strands of pale blue smoke drifting\nacross the mirror and heard the electric lighter snap back on its cable into\nplace behind the back of the seat.\n"I think I understand you better, now, sir," I said.\n"Very good, my boy."\n"Shall I continue in this direction, sir?"\n"By all means," he said, looking out at the countryside. "I\'ve never\nseen this section before. It\'s new territory for me."\nHalf-consciously I followed the white line as I drove, thinking about\nwhat he had said. Then as we took a hill we were swept by a wave of\nscorching air and it was as though we were approaching a desert. It almost\ntook my breath away and I leaned over and switched on the fan, hearing its\nsudden whirr.\n"Thank you," he said as a slight breeze filled the car.\nWe were passing a collection of shacks and log cabins now, bleached\nwhite and warped by the weather. Sun-tortured shingles lay on the roofs like\ndecks of water-soaked cards spread out to dry. The houses consisted of two\nsquare rooms joined together by a common floor and roof with a porch in\nbetween. As we passed we could look through to the fields beyond. I stopped\nthe car at his excited command in front of a house set off from the rest.\n"Is that a log cabin?"\nIt was an old cabin with its chinks filled with chalk-white clay, with\nbright new shingles patching its roof. Suddenly I was sorry that I had\nblundered down this road. I recognized the place as soon as I saw the group\nof children in stiff new overalls who played near a rickety fence.\n"Yes, sir. It is a log cabin," I said.\nIt was the cabin of Jim Trueblood, a sharecropper who had brought\ndisgrace upon the black community. Several months before he had caused\nquite a bit of outrage up at the school, and now his name was never\nmentioned above a whisper. Even before that he had seldom come near the\ncampus but had been well liked as a hard worker who took good care of his\nfamily\'s needs, and as one who told the old stories with a sense of humor\nand a magic that made them come alive. He was also a good tenor singer,\nand sometimes when special white guests visited the school he was brought\nup along with the members of a country quartet to sing what the officials\ncalled "their primitive spirituals" when we assembled in the chapel on Sunday\nevenings. We were embarrassed by the earthy harmonies they sang, but since\nthe visitors were awed we dared not laugh at the crude, high, plaintively\nanimal sounds Jim Trueblood made as he led the quartet. That had all\npassed now with his disgrace, and what on the part of the school officials\nhad been an attitude of contempt blunted by tolerance, had now become a\ncontempt sharpened by hate. I didn\'t understand in those pre-invisible days\nthat their hate, and mine too, was charged with fear. How all of us at the\ncollege hated the black-belt people, the "peasants," during those days! We\nwere trying to lift them up and they, like Trueblood, did everything it seemed\nto pull us down.\n"It appears quite old," Mr. Norton said, looking across the bare, hard\nstretch of yard where two women dressed in new blue-and-white checked\nginghams were washing clothes in an iron pot. The pot was soot-black and\nthe feeble flames that licked its sides showed pale pink and bordered with\nblack, like flames in mourning. Both women moved with the weary,\nfull-fronted motions of far-gone pregnancy.\n"It is, sir," I said. "That one and the other two like it were built\nduring slavery times."\n"You don\'t say! I would never have believed that they were so\nenduring. Since slavery times!"\n"That\'s true, sir. And the white family that owned the land when it\nwas a big plantation still lives in town."\n"Yes," he said, "I know that many of the old families still survive.\nAnd individuals too, the human stock goes on, even though it degenerates.\nBut these cabinsl" He seemed surprised and confounded.\n"Do you suppose those women know anything about the age and\nhistory of the place? The older one looks as though she might."\n"I doubt it, sir. They -- they don\'t seem very bright."\n"Bright?" he said, removing his cigar. "You mean that they wouldn\'t\ntalk with me?" he asked suspiciously.\n"Yes, sir. That\'s it."\n"Why not?"\nI didn\'t want to explain. It made me feel ashamed, but he sensed\nthat I knew something and pressed me.\n"It\'s not very nice, sir. But I don\'t think those women would talk to\nus."\n"We can explain that we\'re from the school. Surely they\'ll talk then.\nYou may tell them who I am."\n"Yes, sir," I said, "but they hate us up at the school. They never\ncome there . . ."\n"What!"\n"No, sir."\n"And those children along the fence down there?"\n"They don\'t either, sir."\n"But why?"\n"I don\'t really know, sir. Quite a few folks out this way don\'t,\nthough. I guess they\'re too ignorant. They\'re not interested."\n"But I can\'t believe it."\nThe children had stopped playing and now looked silently at the car,\ntheir arms behind their backs and their new over-sized overalls pulled tight\nover their little pot bellies as though they too were pregnant.\n"What about their men folk?"\nI hesitated. Why did he find this so strange?\n"He hates us, sir," I said.\n"You say he; aren\'t both the women married?"\nI caught my breath. I\'d made a mistake. "The old one is, sir," I said\nreluctantly.\n"What happened to the young woman\'s husband?"\n"She doesn\'t have any -- That is . . . I --"\n"What is it, young man? Do you know these people?"\n"Only a little, sir. There was some talk about them up on the\ncampus a while back."\n"What talk?"\n"Well, the young woman is the old woman\'s daughter . . ."\n"And?"\n"Well, sir, they say . . . you see . . . I mean they say the daughter\ndoesn\'t have a husband."\n"Oh, I see. But that shouldn\'t be so strange. I understand that your\npeople -- Never mind! Is that all?"\n"Well, sir . . ."\n"Yes, what else?"\n"They say that her father did it."\n"What!"\n"Yes, sir . . . that he gave her the baby."\nI heard the sharp intake of breath, like a toy balloon suddenly\ndeflated. His face reddened. I was confused, feeling shame for the two women\nand fear that I had talked too much and offended his sensibilities.\n"And did anyone from the school investigate this matter?" he asked\nat last.\n"Yes, sir," I said.\n"What was discovered?"\n"That it was true -- they say."\n"But how does he explain his doing such a -- a -- such a monstrous\nthing?"\nHe sat back in the seat, his hands grasping his knees, his knuckles\nbloodless. I looked away, down the heat-dazzling concrete of the highway. I\nwished we were back on the other side of the white line, heading back to the\nquiet green stretch of the campus.\n"It is said that the man took both his wife and his daughter?"\n"Yes, sir."\n"And that he is the father of both their children?"\n"Yes, sir."\n"No, no, no!"\nHe sounded as though he were in great pain. I looked at him\nanxiously. What had happened? What had I said?\n"Not that! No . . ." he said, with something like horror.\nI saw the sun blaze upon the new blue overalls as the man appeared\naround the cabin. His shoes were tan and new and he moved easily over the\nhot earth. He was a small man and he covered the yard with a familiarity\nthat would have allowed him to walk in the blackest darkness with the same\ncertainty. He came and said something to the women as he fanned himself\nwith a blue bandanna handkerchief. But they appeared to regard him sullenly,\nbarely speaking, and hardly looking in his direction.\n"Would that be the man?" Mr. Norton asked.\n"Yes, sir. I think so."\n"Get out!" he cried. "I must talk with him."\nI was unable to move. I felt surprise and a dread and resentment of\nwhat he might say to Trueblood and his women, the questions he might ask.\nWhy couldn\'t he leave them alone!\n"Hurry!"\nI climbed from the car and opened the rear door. He clambered out\nand almost ran across the road to the yard, as though compelled by some\npressing urgency which I could not understand. Then suddenly I saw the two\nwomen turn and run frantically behind the house, their movements heavy and\nflatfooted. I hurried behind him, seeing him stop when he reached the man\nand the children. They became silent, their faces clouding over, their features\nbecoming soft and negative, their eyes bland and deceptive. They were\ncrouching behind their eyes waiting for him to speak -- just as I recognized\nthat I was trembling behind my own. Up close I saw what I had not seen\nfrom the car: The man had a scar on his right cheek, as though he had been\nhit in the face with a sledge. The wound was raw and moist and from time\nto time he lifted his handkerchief to fan away the gnats.\n"I, I --" Mr. Norton stammered, "I must talk with you!"\n"All right, suh," Jim Trueblood said without surprise and waited.\n"Is it true . . . I mean did you?"\n"Suh?" Trueblood asked, as I looked away.\n"You have survived," he blurted. "But is it true . . .?"\n"Suh?" the farmer said, his brow wrinkling with bewilderment.\n"I\'m sorry, sir," I said, "but I don\'t think he understands you."\nHe ignored me, staring into Trueblood\'s face as though reading a\nmessage there which I could not perceive.\n"You did and are unharmed!" he shouted, his blue eyes blazing into\nthe black face with something like envy and indignation. Trueblood looked\nhelplessly at me. I looked away. I understood no more than he.\n"You have looked upon chaos and are not destroyed!"\n"No suh! I feels all right."\n"You do? You feel no inner turmoil, no need to cast out the\noffending eye?"\n"Suh?"\n"Answer me!"\n"I\'m all right, suh," Trueblood said uneasily. "My eyes is all right too.\nAnd when I feels po\'ly in my gut I takes a little soda and it goes away."\n"No, no, no! Let us go where there is shade," he said, looking about\nexcitedly and going swiftly to where the porch cast a swath of shade. We\nfollowed him. The farmer placed his hand on my shoulder, but I shook it off,\nknowing that I could explain nothing. We sat on the porch in a semicircle in\ncamp chairs, me between the sharecropper and the millionaire. The earth\naround the porch was hard and white from where wash water had long been\nthrown.\n"How are you faring now?" Mr. Norton asked. "Perhaps I could\nhelp."\n"We ain\'t doing so bad, suh. \'Fore they heard \'bout what happen to\nus out here I couldn\'t git no help from nobody. Now lotta folks is curious\nand goes outta they way to help. Even the biggity school folks up on the hill,\nonly there was a catch to it! They offered to send us clean outta the county,\npay our way and everything and give me a hundred dollars to git settled\nwith. But we likes it here so I told \'em No. Then they sent a fellow out here,\na big fellow too, and he said if I didn\'t leave they was going to turn the\nwhite folks loose on me. It made me mad and it made me scared. Them\nfolks up there to the school is in strong with the white folks and that scared\nme. But I thought when they first come out here that they was different from\nwhen I went up there a long time ago looking for some book learning and\nsome points on how to handle my crops. That was when I had my own\nplace. I thought they was trying to he\'p me, on accounta I got two women\ndue to birth \'bout the same time.\n"But I got mad when I found they was tryin\' to git rid of us \'cause\nthey said we was a disgrace. Yessuh, I got real mad. So I went down to see\nMr. Buchanan, the boss man, and I tole him \'bout it and he give me a note\nto the sheriff and tole me to take it to him. I did that, jus\' like he tole me. I\nwent to the jailhouse and give Sheriff Barbour the note and he ask me to tell\nhim what happen, and I tole him and he called in some more men and they\nmade me tell it again. They wanted to hear about the gal lots of times and\nthey gimme somethin\' to eat and drink and some tobacco. Surprised me,\n\'cause I was scared and spectin\' somethin\' different. Why, I guess there ain\'t\na colored man in the county who ever got to take so much of the white\nfolkses\' time as I did. So finally they tell me not to worry, that they was\ngoing to send word up to the school that I was to stay right where I am.\nThem big nigguhs didn\'t bother me, neither. It just goes to show yuh that no\nmatter how biggity a nigguh gits, the white folks can always cut him down.\nThe white folks took up for me. And the white folks took to coming out here\nto see us and talk with us. Some of \'em was big white folks, too, from the\nbig school way cross the State. Asked me lots \'bout what I thought \'bout\nthings, and \'bout my folks and the kids, and wrote it all down in a book. But\nbest of all, suh, I got more work now than I ever did have before . . ."\nHe talked willingly now, with a kind of satisfaction and no trace of\nhesitancy or shame. The old man listened with a puzzled expression as he\nheld an unlit cigar in his delicate fingers.\n"Things is pretty good now," the farmer said. "Ever time I think of\nhow cold it was and what a hard time we was having I gits the shakes."\nI saw him bite into a plug of chewing tobacco. Something tinkled\nagainst the porch and I picked it up, gazing at it from time to time. It was a\nhard red apple stamped out of tin.\n"You see, suh, it was cold and us didn\'t have much fire. Nothin\' but\nwood, no coal. I tried to git help but wouldn\'t nobody help us and I couldn\'t\nfind no work or nothin\'. It was so cold all of us had to sleep together; me,\nthe ole lady and the gal. That\'s how it started, suh."\nHe cleared his throat, his eyes gleaming and his voice taking on a\ndeep, incantatory quality, as though he had told the story many, many times.\nFlies and fine white gnats swarmed about his wound.\n"That\'s the way it was," he said. "Me on one side and the ole lady\non the other and the gal in the middle. It was dark, plum black. Black as the\nmiddle of a bucket of tar. The kids was sleeping all together in they bed over\nin the corner. I must have been the last one to go to sleep, \'cause I was\nthinking \'bout how to git some grub for the next day and \'bout the gal and\nthe young boy what was startin\' to hang \'round her. I didn\'t like him and he\nkept comin\' through my thoughts and I made up my mind to warn him away\nfrom the gal. It was black dark and I heard one of the kids whimper in his\nsleep and the last few sticks of kindlin\' crackin\' and settlin\' in the stove and\nthe smell of the fat meat seemed to git cold and still in the air just like\nmeat grease when it gits set in a cold plate of molasses. And I was thinkin\'\n\'bout the gal and this boy and feelin\' her arms besides me and hearing the\nole lady snorin\' with a kinda moanin\' and a-groanin\' on the other side. I was\nworryin\' \'bout my family, how they was goin\' to eat and all, and I thought\n\'bout when the gal was little like the younguns sleepin\' over in the corner\nand how I was her favorite over the ole lady. There we was, breathin\'\ntogether in the dark. Only I could see \'em in my mind, knowin\' \'em like I\ndo. In my mind I looked at all of \'em, one by one. The gal looks just like\nthe ole lady did when she was young and I first met her, only better lookin\'.\nYou know, we gittin\' to be a better-lookin\' race of people . . .\n"Anyway, I could hear \'em breathin\' and though I hadn\'t been it\nmade me sleepy. Then I heard the gal say, \'Daddy,\' soft and low in her sleep\nand I looked, tryin\' to see if she was still awake. But all I can do is smell\nher and feel her breath on my hand when I go to touch her. She said it so\nsoft I couldn\'t be sure I had heard anything, so I just laid there listenin\'.\nSeems like I heard a whippoorwill callin\', and I thought to myself, Go on\naway from here, we\'ll whip ole Will when we find him. Then I heard the\nclock up there at the school strikin\' four times, lonesome like.\n"Then I got to thinkin\' \'bout way back when I left the farm and went\nto live in Mobile and \'bout a gal I had me then. I was young then -- like\nthis young fellow here. Us lived in a two-story house \'longside the river, and\nat night in the summertime we used to lay in bed and talk, and after she\'d\ngone off to sleep I\'d be awake lookin\' out at the lights comin\' up from the\nwater and listenin\' to the sounds of the boats movin\' along. They used to\nhave musicianers on them boats, and sometimes I used to wake her up to\nhear the music when they come up the river. I\'d be layin\' there and it would\nbe quiet and I could hear it comin\' from way, way off. Like when you quail\nhuntin\' and it\'s getting dark and you can hear the boss bird whistlin\' tryin\' to\nget the covey together again, and he\'s coming toward you slow and whistlin\'\nsoft, cause he knows you somewhere around with your gun. Still he got to\nround them up, so he keeps on comin\'. Them boss quails is like a good man,\nwhat he got to do he do.\n"Well, that\'s the way the boats used to sound. Comin\' close to you\nfrom far away. First one would be comin\' to you when you almost sleep and\nit sounded like somebody hittin\' at you slow with a big shiny pick. You see\nthe pick-point comin\' straight at you, comin\' slow too, and you can\'t dodge;\nonly when it goes to hit you it ain\'t no pick a\'tall but somebody far away\nbreakin\' little bottles of all kindsa colored glass. It\'s still comin\' at you\nthough. Still comin\'. Then you hear it close up, like when you up in the\nsecond-story window and look down on a wagonful of watermelons, and you\nsee one of them young juicy melons split wide open a-layin\' all spread out\nand cool and sweet on top of all the striped green ones like it\'s waitin\' just\nfor you, so you can see how red and ripe and juicy it is and all the shiny\nblack seeds it\'s got and all. And you could hear the sidewheels splashin\' like\nthey don\'t want to wake nobody up; and us, me and the gal, would lay there\nfeelin\' like we was rich folks and them boys on the boats would be playin\'\nsweet as good peach brandy wine. Then the boats would be past and the\nlights would be gone from the window and the music would be goin\' too.\nKinda like when you watch a gal in a red dress and a wide straw hat goin\'\npast you down a lane with the trees on both sides, and she\'s plump and\njuicy and kinda switchin\' her tail \'cause she knows you watchin\' and you\nknow she know, and you just stands there and watches \'til you can\'t see\nnothin\' but the top of her red hat and then that goes and you know she\ndone dropped behind a hill -- I seen me a gal like that once. All I could\nhear then would be that Mobile gal -- name of Margaret -- she be breathin\'\nbeside me, and maybe \'bout that time she\'d say, \'Daddy, you still \'wake?\' and\nthen I\'d grunt, \'Uhhuh\' and drop on off -- Gent\'mens," Jim Trueblood said, "I\nlikes to recall them Mobile days.\n"Well, it was like that when I heard Matty Lou say, \'Daddy,\' and I\nknowed she musta been dreamin\' \'bout somebody from the way she said it\nand I gits mad wonderin\' if it\'s that boy. I listen to her mumblin\' for a while\ntryin\' to hear if she calls his name, but she don\'t, and I remember that they\nsay if you put the hand of a person who\'s talkin\' in his sleep in warm water\nhe\'ll say it all, but the water is too cold and I wouldn\'t have done it anyway.\nBut I\'m realizin\' that she\'s a woman now, when I feels her turn and squirm\nagainst me and throw her arm across my neck, up where the cover didn\'t\nreach and I was cold. She said somethin\' I couldn\'t understand, like a woman\nsays when she wants to tease and please a man. I knowed then she was\ngrown and I wondered how many times it\'d done happened and was it that\ndoggone boy. I moved her arm and it was soft, but it didn\'t wake her, so I\ncalled her, but that didn\'t wake her neither. Then I turned my back and tried\nto move away, though there wasn\'t much room and I could still feel her\ntouchin\' me, movin\' close to me. Then I musta dropped into the dream. I\nhave to tell you \'bout that dream."\nI looked at Mr. Norton and stood up, thinking that now was a good\ntime to leave; but he was listening to Trueblood so intensely he didn\'t see\nme, and I sat down again, cursing the farmer silently. To hell with his\ndream!\n"I don\'t quite remember it all, but I remember that I was lookin\' for\nsome fat meat. I went to the white folks downtown and they said go see Mr.\nBroadnax, that he\'d give it to me. Well, he lives up on a hill and I was\nclimbin\' up there to see him. Seems like that was the highest hill in the\nworld. The more I climbed the farther away Mr. Broadnax\'s house seems to\ngit. But finally I do reach there. And I\'m so tired and restless to git to the\nman, I goes through the front door! I knows it\'s wrong, but I can\'t help it. I\ngoes in and I\'m standin\' in a big room full of lighted candles and shiny\nfurniture and pictures on the walls, and soft stuff on the floor. But I don\'t\nsee a livin\' soul. So I calls his name, but still don\'t nobody come and don\'t\nnobody answer. So I sees a door and goes through that door and I\'m in a\nbig white bedroom, like I seen one time when I was a little ole boy and went\nto the big house with my Ma. Everything in the room was white and I\'m\nstandin\' there knowin\' I got no business in there, but there anyhow. It\'s a\nwoman\'s room too. I tries to git out, but I don\'t find the door; and all\naround me I can smell woman, can smell it gittin\' stronger all the time. Then\nI looks over in a corner and sees one of them tall grandfather clocks and I\nhears it strikin\' and the glass door is openin\' and a white lady is steppin\' out\nof it. She got on a nightgown of soft white silky stuff and nothin\' else, and\nshe looks straight at me. I don\'t know what to do. I wants to run, but the\nonly door I see is the one in the clock she\'s standin\' in -- and anyway, I\ncan\'t move and this here clock is keepin\' up a heapa racket. It\'s gittin\' faster\nand faster all the time. I tries to say somethin\', but I caint. Then she starts\nto screamin\' and I thinks I done gone deef, \'cause though I can see her\nmouth working, I don\'t hear nothin\'. Yit I can still hear the clock and I tries\nto tell her I\'m just lookin\' for Mr. Broadnax but she don\'t hear me. Instead\nshe runs up and grabs me around the neck and holds tight, tryin\' to keep me\nout of the clock. I don\'t know what to do then, sho \'nough. I tries to talk to\nher, and I tries to git away. But she\'s holdin\' me and I\'m scared to touch her\ncause she\'s white. Then I gits so scared that I throws her on the bed and\ntries to break her holt. That woman just seemed to sink outta sight, that\nthere bed was so soft. It\'s sinkin\' down so far I think it\'s going to smother\nboth of us. Then swoosh! all of a sudden a flock of little white geese flies out\nof the bed like they say you see when you go to dig for buried money. Lawd!\nthey hadn\'t no more\'n disappeared than I heard a door open and Mr.\nBroadnax\'s voice said, \'They just nigguhs, leave \'em do it.\' "\nHow can he tell this to white men, I thought, when he knows they\'ll\nsay that all Negroes do such things? I looked at the floor, a red mist of\nanguish before my eyes.\n"And I caint stop -- although I got a feelin\' somethin\' is wrong. I git\nloose from the woman now and I\'m runnin\' for the clock. At first I couldn\'t\ngit the door open, it had some kinda crinkly stuff like steel wool on the\nfacing. But I gits it open and gits inside and it\'s hot and dark in there. I\ngoes up a dark tunnel, up near where the machinery is making all that noise\nand heat. It\'s like the power plant they got up to the school. It\'s burnin\' hot\nas iffen the house was caught on fire, and I starts to runnin\', try-in\' to git\nout. I runs and runs till I should be tired but ain\'t tired but feelin\' more\nrested as I runs, and runnin\' so good it\'s like flyin\' and I\'m flyin\' and sailin\'\nand floatin\' right up over the town. Only I\'m still in the tunnel. Then way up\nahead I sees a bright light like a jack-o-lantern over a graveyard. It gits\nbrighter and brighter and I know I got to catch up with it or else. Then all\nat once I was right up with it and it burst like a great big electric light in\nmy eyes and scalded me all over. Only it wasn\'t a scald, but like I was\ndrownin\' in a lake where the water was hot on the top and had cold numbin\'\ncurrents down under it. Then all at once I\'m through it and I\'m relieved to\nbe out and in the cool daylight agin.\n"I wakes up intendin\' to tell the ole lady \'bout my crazy dream.\nMorning done come, and it\'s gettin\' almost light. And there I am, lookin\'\nstraight in Matty Lou\'s face and she\'s beatin\' me and scratchin\' and tremblin\'\nand shakin\' and cryin\' all at the same time like she\'s havin\' a fit. I\'m too\nsurprised to move. She\'s cryin\', \'Daddy, Daddy, oh Daddy,\' just like that. And\nall at once I remember the ole lady. She\'s right beside us snorin\' and I can\'t\nmove \'cause I figgers if I moved it would be a sin And I figgers too, that if I\ndon\'t move it maybe ain\'t no sin, \'cause it happened when I was asleep --\nalthough maybe sometimes a man can look at a little ole pigtail gal and see\nhim a whore -- you\'all know that? Anyway, I realizes that if I don\'t move the\nole lady will see me. I don\'t want that to happen. That would be worse than\nsin. I\'m whisperin\' to Matty Lou, tryin\' to keep her quiet and I\'m figurin\' how\nto git myself out of the fix I\'m in without sinnin\'. I almost chokes her.\n"But once a man gits hisself in a tight spot like that there ain\'t much\nhe can do. It ain\'t up to him no longer. There I was, tryin\' to git away with\nall my might, yet having to move without movin\'. I flew in but I had to walk\nout. I had to move without movin\'. I done thought \'bout it since a heap, and\nwhen you think right hard you see that that\'s the way things is always been\nwith me. That\'s just about been my life. There was only one way I can figger\nthat I could git out: that was with a knife. But I didn\'t have no knife, and if\nyou\'all ever seen them geld them young boar pigs in the fall, you know I\nknowed that that was too much to pay to keep from sinnin\'. Everything was\nhappenin\' inside of me like a fight was goin\' on. Then just the very thought\nof the fix I\'m in puts the iron back in me.\n"Then if that ain\'t bad enough, Matty Lou can\'t hold out no longer\nand gits to movin\' herself. First she was tryin\' to push me away and I\'m\ntryin\' to hold her down to keep from sinnin\'. Then I\'m pullin\' away and\nshushin\' her to be quiet so\'s not to wake her Ma, when she grabs holt to me\nand holds tight. She didn\'t want me to go then -- and to tell the\nhonest-to-God truth I found out that I didn\'t want to go neither. I guess I\nfelt then, at that time -- and although I been sorry since -- just \'bout like\nthat fellow did down in Birmingham. That one what locked hisself in his\nhouse and shot at them police until they set fire to the house and burned\nhim up. I was lost. The more wringlin\' and twistin\' we done tryin\' to git\naway, the more we wanted to stay. So like that fellow, I stayed, I had to\nfight it on out to the end. He mighta died, but I suspects now that he got a\nheapa satisfaction before he went. I know there ain\'t nothin\' like what I went\nthrough, I caint tell how it was. It\'s like when a real drinkin\' man gits drunk,\nor when a real sanctified religious woman gits so worked up she jumps outta\nher clothes, or when a real gamblin\' man keeps on gamblin\' when he\'s losin\'.\nYou got holt to it and you caint let go even though you want to."\n"Mr. Norton, sir," I said in a choked voice, "it\'s time we were getting\nback to the campus. You\'ll miss your appointments . . ."\nHe didn\'t even look at me. "Please," he said, waving his hand in\nannoyance.\nTrueblood seemed to smile at me behind his eyes as he looked from\nthe white man to me and continued.\n"I couldn\'t even let go when I heard Kate scream. It was a scream to\nmake your blood run cold. It sounds like a woman who was watchin\' a team\nof wild horses run down her baby chile and she caint move. Kate\'s hair is\nstandin\' up like she done seen a ghost, her gown is hanging open and the\nveins in her neck is \'bout to bust. And her eyes! Lawd, them eyes. I\'m lookin\'\nup at her from where I\'m layin\' on the pallet with Matty Lou, and I\'m too\nweak to move. She screams and starts to pickin\' up the first thing that comes\nto her hand and throwin\' it. Some of them misses me and some of them hits\nme. Little things and big things. Somethin\' cold and strong-stinkin\' hits me\nand wets me and bangs against my head. Somethin\' hits the wall --\nboom-a-loom-a-loom! -- like a cannon ball, and I tries to cover up my head.\nKate\'s talkin\' the unknown tongue, like a wild woman.\n" \'Wait a minit, Kate,\' I says. \'Stop it!\'\n"Then I hears her stop a second and I hears her runnin\' across the\nfloor, and I twists and looks and Lawd, she done got my double-barrel\nshotgun!\n"And while she\'s foamin\' at the mouth and cockin\' the gun, she gits\nher speech.\n" \'Git up! Git up!\' she says.\n" \'HEY! NAW! KATE!\' I says.\n" \'Goddam yo\' soul to hell! Git up offa my chile!\'\n" \'But woman, Kate, lissen . . .\'\n" \'Don\'t talk, MOVE!\'\n" \'Down that thing, Kate!\'\n" \'No down, UP!\'\n" \'That there\'s buckshot, woman, BUCKshot!\'\n" \'Yes, it is!\'\n" \'Down it, I say!"\n" \'I\'m gon blast your soul to hell!\'\n" \'You gon hit Matty Lou!\'\n" \'Not Matty Lou -- YOU!\'\n" \'It spreads, Kate. Matty Lou!\'\n"She moves around, aimin\' at me.\n" \'I done warn you, Jim . . .\'\n" \'Kate, it was a dream. Lissen to me . . .\'\n" \'You the one who lissen -- UP FROM THERE!\'\n"She jerks the gun and I shuts my eyes. But insteada thunder and\nlightin\' bustin\' me, I hears Matty Lou scream in my ear,\n" \'Mamma! Oooooo, MAMA!\'\n"I rolls almost over then and Kate hesitates. She looks at the gun,\nand she looks at us, and she shivers a minit like she got the fever. Then all\nat once she drops the gun, and ZIP! quick as a cat, she turns and grabs\nsomethin\' off the stove. It catches me like somebody diggin\' into my side with\na sharp spade. I caint breathe. She\'s throwin\' and talkin\' all at the same time.\n"And when I looks up, Maan, Maaan! she\'s got a iron in her hand!\n"I hollers, \'No blood, Kate. Don\'t spill no blood!\'\n" \'You low-down dog,\' she says, \'it\'s better to spill than to foul!\'\n" \'Naw, Kate. Things ain\'t what they \'pear! Don\'t make no blood-sin\non accounta no dream-sin!"\n" \'Shut up, nigguh. You done fouled!\'\n"But I sees there ain\'t no use reasonin\' with her then. I makes up\nmy mind that I\'m goin\' to take whatever she gimme. It seems to me that all\nI can do is take my punishment. I tell myself, Maybe if you suffer for it, it\nwill be best. Maybe you owe it to Kate to let her beat you. You ain\'t guilty,\nbut she thinks you is. You don\'t want her to beat you, but she think she got\nto beat you. You want to git up, but you too weak to move.\n"I was too. I was frozen to where I was like a youngun what done\nstuck his lip to a pump handle in the wintertime. I was just like a jaybird\nthat the yellow jackets done stung \'til he\'s paralyzed -- but still alive in his\neyes and he\'s watchin\' \'em sting his body to death.\n"It made me seem to go way back a distance in my head, behind my\neyes, like I was standin\' behind a windbreak durin\' a storm. I looks out and\nsees Kate runnin\' toward me draggin\' something behind her. I tries to see\nwhat it is \'cause I\'m curious \'bout it and sees her gown catch on the stove\nand her hand comin\' in sight with somethin\' in it. I thinks to myself, It\'s a\nhandle. What she got the handle to? Then I sees her right up on me, big.\nShe\'s swingin\' her arms like a man swingin\' a ten-pound sledge and I sees\nthe knuckles of her hand is bruised and bleedin\', and I sees it catch in her\ngown and I sees her gown go up so I can see her thighs and I sees how\nrusty and gray the cold done made her skin, and I sees her bend and\nstraightenin\' up and I hears her grunt and I sees her swing and I smells her\nsweat and I knows by the shape of the shinin\' wood what she\'s got to put on\nme. Lawd, yes! I sees it catch on a quilt this time and raise that quilt up\nand drop it on the floor. Then I sees that ax come free! It\'s shinin\', shinin\'\nfrom the sharpenin\' I\'d give it a few days before, and man, way back in\nmyself, behind that windbreak, I says,\n" \'NAAW! KATE -- Lawd, Kate, NAW!!!\' "\nSuddenly his voice was so strident that I looked up startled.\nTrueblood seemed to look straight through Mr. Norton, his eyes glassy. The\nchildren paused guiltily at their play, looking toward their father.\n"I might as well been pleadin\' with a switch engine," he went on. "I\nsees it comin\' down. I sees the light catchin\' on it, I sees Kate\'s face all\nmean and I tightens my shoulders and stiffens my neck and I waits -- ten\nmillion back-breakin\' years, it seems to me like I waits. I waits so long I\nremembers all the wrong things I ever done; I waits so long I opens my eyes\nand closes \'em and opens my eyes agin, and I sees it fallin\'. It\'s fallin\' fast as\nflops from a six-foot ox, and while I\'m waitin\' I feels somethin\' wind up\ninside of me and turn to water. I sees it, Lawd, yes! I sees it and seein\' it I\ntwists my head aside. Couldn\'t help it; Kate has a good aim, but for that. I\nmoves. Though I meant to keep still, I moved! Anybody but Jesus Christ\nhisself woulda moved. I feel like the whole side of my face is smashed clear\noff. It hits me like hot lead so hot that insteada burnin\' me it numbs me.\nI\'m layin\' there on the floor, but inside me I\'m runnin\' round in circles like a\ndog with his back broke, and back into that numbness with my tail tucked\nbetween my legs. I feels like I don\'t have no skin on my face no more, only\nthe naked bone. But this is the part I don\'t understand: more\'n the pain and\nnumbness I feels relief. Yes, and to git some more of that relief I seems to\nrun out from behind the windbreak again and up to where Kate\'s standin\'\nwith the ax, and I opens my eyes and waits. That\'s the truth. I wants some\nmore and I waits. I sees her swing it, lookin\' down on me, and I sees it in\nthe air and I holds my breath, then all of a sudden I sees it stop like\nsomebody done reached down through the roof and caught it, and I sees her\nface have a spasm and I sees the ax fall, back of her this time, and hit the\nfloor, and Kate spews out some puke and I close my eyes and waits. I can\nhear her moanin\' and stumblin\' out of the door and fallin\' off the porch into\nthe yard. Then I hears her pukin\' like all her guts is coming up by the roots.\nThen I looks down and seen blood runnin\' all over Matty Lou. It\'s my blood,\nmy face is bleedin\'. That gits me to movin\'. I gits up and stumbles out to\nfind Kate, and there she is under the cottonwood tree out there, on her\nknees, and she\'s moanin\'.\n" \'What have I done, Lawd! What have I done!\'\n"She\'s droolin\' green stuff and gits to pukin\' agin, and when I goes\nto touch her it gits worse. I stands there holdin\' my face and tryin\' to keep\nthe blood from flowin\' and wonders what on earth is gonna happen. I looks\nup at the mornin\' sun and expects somehow for it to thunder. But it\'s already\nbright and clear and the sun comin\' up and the birds is chirpin\' and I gits\nmore afraid then than if a bolt of lightnin\' had struck me. I yells, \'Have\nmercy, Lawd! Lawd, have mercy!\' and waits. And there\'s nothin\' but the clear\nbright mornin\' sun.\n"But don\'t nothin\' happen and I knows then that somethin\' worse\nthan anything I ever heard \'bout is in store for me. I musta stood there stark\nstone still for half an hour. I was still standin\' there when Kate got off her\nknees and went back into the house. The blood was runnin\' all over my\nclothes and the flies was after me, and I went back inside to try and stop it.\n"When I see Matty Lou stretched out there I think she\'s dead. Ain\'t\nno color in her face and she ain\'t hardly breathin\'. She gray in the face. I\ntries to help her but I can\'t do no good and Kate won\'t speak to me nor\nlook at me even; and I thinks maybe she plans to try to kill me agin, but\nshe don\'t. I\'m in such a daze I just sits there the whole time while she\nbundles up the younguns and takes \'em down the road to Will Nichols\'. I can\nsee but I caint do nothin\'.\n"And I\'m still settin\' there when she comes back with some women\nto see \'bout Matty Lou. Won\'t nobody speak to me, though they looks at me\nlike I\'m some new kinda cotton-pickin\' machine. I feels bad. I tells them how\nit happened in a dream, but they scorns me. I gits plum out of the house\nthen. I goes to see the preacher and even he don\'t believe me. He tells me to\ngit out ot his house, that I\'m the most wicked man he\'s ever seen and that I\nbetter go confess my sin and make my peace with God. I leaves tryin\' to\npray, but I caint. I thinks and thinks, until I thinks my brain go\'n bust, \'bout\nhow I\'m guilty and how I ain\'t guilty. I don\'t eat nothin\' and I don\'t drink\nnothin\' and caint sleep at night. Finally, one night, way early in the mornin\',\nI looks up and sees the stars and I starts singin\'. I don\'t mean to, I didn\'t\nthink \'bout it, just start singin\'. I don\'t know what it was, some kinda church\nsong, I guess. All I know is I ends up singin\' the blues. I sings me some\nblues that night ain\'t never been sang before, and while I\'m singin\' them\nblues I makes up my mind that I ain\'t nobody but myself and ain\'t nothin\' I\ncan do but let whatever is gonna happen, happen. I made up my mind that I\nwas goin\' back home and face Kate; yeah, and face Matty Lou too.\n"When I gits here everybody thinks I done run off. There\'s a heap of\nwomen here with Kate and I runs \'em out. And when I runs \'em out I sends\nthe younguns out to play and locks the door and tells Kate and Matty Lou\n\'bout the dream and how I\'m sorry, but that what done happen is done\nhappen.\n" \'How come you don\'t go on \'way and leave us?\' is the first words\nKate says to me. \'Ain\'t you done enough to me and this chile?\'\n" \'I caint leave you,\' I says. \'I\'m a man and man don\'t leave his\nfamily.\'\n"She says, \'Naw, you ain\'t no man. No man\'d do what you did.\'\n" \'I\'m still a man,\' I says.\n" \'But what you gon\' do after it happens?\' says Kate.\n" \'After what happens?\' I says.\n" \'When yo black \'bomination is birthed to bawl yo wicked sin befo\nthe eyes of God!\' (She musta learned them words from the preacher.)\n" \'Birth?\' I says. \'Who birth?\'\n" \'Both of us. Me birth and Matty Lou birth. Both of us birth, you\ndirty lowdown wicked dog!\'\n"That liketa killed me. I can understand then why Matty Lou won\'t\nlook at me and won\'t speak a word to nobody.\n" \'If you stay I\'m goin\' over an\' git Aunt Cloe for both of us,\' Kate\nsays. She says, \'I don\'t aim to birth no sin for folks to look at all the rest of\nmy life, and I don\'t aim for Matty Lou to neither.\'\n"You see, Aunt Cloe is a midwife, and even weak as I am from this\nnews I knows I don\'t want her foolin\' with my womenfolks. That woulda been\npilin\' sin up on toppa sin. So I told Kate, naw, that if Aunt Cloe come near\nthis house I\'d kill her, old as she is. I\'da done it too. That settles it. I walks\nout of the house and leaves \'em here to cry it out between \'em. I wanted to\ngo off by myself agin, but it don\'t do no good tryin\' to run off from\nsomethin\' like that. It follows you wherever you go. Besides, to git right down\nto the facts, there wasn\'t nowhere I could go. I didn\'t have a cryin\' dime!\n"Things got to happenin\' right off. The nigguhs up at the school\ncome down to chase me off and that made me mad. I went to see the white\nfolks then and they gave me help. That\'s what I don\'t understand. I done the\nworse thing a man could ever do in his family and instead of chasin\' me out\nof the county, they gimme more help than they ever give any other colored\nman, no matter how good a nigguh he was. Except that my wife an\' daughter\nwon\'t speak to me, I\'m better off than I ever been before. And even if Kate\nwon\'t speak to me she took the new clothes I brought her from up in town\nand now she\'s gettin\' some eyeglasses made what she been needin\' for so\nlong. But what I don\'t understand is how I done the worse thing a man can\ndo in his own family and \'stead of things gittin\' bad, they got better. The\nnigguhs up at the school don\'t like me, but the white folks treats me fine."\nHE WAS some farmer. As I listened I had been so torn between\nhumiliation and fascination that to lessen my sense of shame I had kept my\nattention riveted upon his intense face. That way I did not have to look at\nMr. Norton. But now as the voice ended I sat looking down at Mr. Norton\'s\nfeet. Out in the yard a woman\'s hoarse contralto intoned a hymn. Children\'s\nvoices were raised in playful chatter. I sat bent over, smelling the sharp dry\nodor of wood burning in the hot sunlight. I stared at the two pairs of shoes\nbefore me. Mr. Norton\'s were white, trimmed with black. They were custom\nmade and there beside the cheap tan brogues of the farmer they had the\nelegantly slender well-bred appearance of fine gloves. Finally someone cleared\nhis throat and I looked up to see Mr. Norton staring silently into Jim\nTrueblood\'s eyes. I was startled. His face had drained of color. With his\nbright eyes burning into Trueblood\'s black face, he looked ghostly. Trueblood\nlooked at me questioningly.\n"Lissen to the younguns," he said in embarrassment. "Playin\' \'London\nBridge\'s Fallin\' Down.\' "\nSomething was going on which I didn\'t get. I had to get Mr. Norton\naway.\n"Are you all right, sir?" I asked.\nHe looked at me with unseeing eyes. "All right?" he said.\n"Yes, sir. I mean that I think it\'s time for the afternoon session," I\nhurried on.\nHe stared at me blankly.\nI went to him. "Are you sure you\'re all right, sir?"\n"Maybe it\'s the heat," Trueblood said. "You got to be born down here\nto stand this kind of heat."\n"Perhaps," Mr. Norton said, "it is the heat. We\'d better go."\nHe stood shakily, still staring intently at Trueblood. Then I saw him\nremoving a red Moroccan-leather wallet from his coat pocket. The\nplatinum-framed miniature came with it, but he did not look at it this time.\n"Here," he said, extending a banknote. "Please take this and buy the\nchildren some toys for me."\nTrueblood\'s mouth fell agape, his eyes widened and filled with\nmoisture as he took the bill between trembling fingers. It was a\nhundred-dollar bill.\n"I\'m ready, young man," Mr. Norton said, his voice a whisper.\nI went before him to the car and opened the door. He stumbled a\nbit climbing in and I gave him my arm. His face was still chalk white.\n"Drive me away from here," he said in a sudden frenzy. "Away!"\n"Yes, sir."\nI saw Jim Trueblood wave as I threw the car into gear. "You\nbastard," I said under my breath. "You no-good bastard! You get a\nhundred-dollar bill!"\nWhen I had turned the car and started back I saw him still standing\nin the same place.\nSuddenly Mr. Norton touched me on the shoulder. "I must have a\nstimulant, young man. A little whiskey."\n"Yes, sir. Are you all right, sir?"\n"A little faint, but a stimulant . . ."\nHis voice trailed off. Something cold formed within my chest. If\nanything happened to him Dr. Bledsoe would blame me. I stepped on the\ngas, wondering where I could get him some whiskey. Not in the town, that\nwould take too long. There was only one place, the Golden Day.\n"I\'ll have you some in a few minutes, sir," I said.\n"As soon as you can," he said.\nChapter 3\nI saw them as we approached the short stretch that lay between the\nrailroad tracks and the Golden Day. At first I failed to recognize them. They\nstraggled down the highway in a loose body, blocking the way from the white\nline to the frazzled weeds that bordered the sun-heated concrete slab. I\ncursed them silently. They were blocking the road and Mr. Norton was\ngasping for breath. Ahead of the radiator\'s gleaming curve they looked like a\nchain gang on its way to make a road. But a chain gang marches single file\nand I saw no guards on horseback. As I drew nearer I recognized the loose\ngray shirts and pants worn by the veterans. Damn! They were heading for the\nGolden Day.\n"A little stimulant," I heard behind me.\n"In a few minutes, sir."\nUp ahead I saw the one who thought he was a drum major strutting\nin front, giving orders as he moved energetically in long, hip-swinging strides,\na cane held above his head, rising and falling as though in time to music. I\nslowed the car as I saw him turn to face the men, his cane held at chest\nlevel as he shortened the pace. The men continued to ignore him, walking\nalong in a mass, some talking in groups and others talking and gesticulating\nto themselves.\nSuddenly, the drum major saw the car and shook his cane-baton at\nme. I blew the horn, seeing the men move over to the side as I nosed the\ncar slowly forward. He held his ground, his legs braced, hands on hips, and\nto keep from hitting him I slammed on the brakes.\nThe drum major rushed past the men toward the car, and I heard\nthe cane bang down upon the hood as he rushed toward me.\n"Who the hell you think you are, running down the army? Give the\ncountersign. Who\'s in command of this outfit? You trucking bastards was\nalways too big for your britches. Countersign me!"\n"This is General Pershing\'s car, sir," I said, remembering hearing that\nhe responded to the name of his wartime Commander-in-Chief. Suddenly the\nwild look changed in his eyes and he stepped back and saluted with stiff\nprecision. Then looking suspiciously into the back seat, he barked,\n"Where\'s the General?"\n"There," I said, turning and seeing Mr. Norton raising himself, weak\nand white-faced, from the seat.\n"What is it? Why have we stopped?"\n"The sergeant stopped us, sir . . ."\n"Sergeant? What sergeant?" He sat up.\n"Is that you, General?" the vet said, saluting. "I didn\'t know you were\ninspecting the front lines today. I\'m very sorry, sir."\n"What . . . ?" Mr. Norton said.\n"The General\'s in a hurry," I said quickly.\n"Sure is," the vet said. "He\'s got a lot to see. Discipline is bad.\nArtillery\'s shot to hell." Then he called to the men walking up the road, "Get\nthe hell out of the General\'s road. General Pershing\'s coming through. Make\nway for General Pershing!"\nHe stepped aside and I shot the car across the line to avoid the men\nand stayed there on the wrong side as I headed for the Golden Day.\n"Who was that man?" Mr. Norton gasped from the back seat.\n"A former soldier, sir. A vet. They\'re all vets, a little shellshocked."\n"But where is the attendant?"\n"I don\'t see one, sir. They\'re harmless though."\n"Nevertheless, they should have an attendant."\nI had to get him there and away before they arrived. This was their\nday to visit the girls, and the Golden Day would be pretty rowdy. I wondered\nwhere the rest of them were. There should have been about fifty. Well, I\nwould rush in and get the whiskey and leave. What was wrong with Mr.\nNorton anyway, why should he get that upset over Trueblood? I had felt\nashamed and several times I had wanted to laugh, but it had made him sick.\nMaybe he needed a doctor. Hell, he didn\'t ask for any doctor. Damn that\nbastard Trueblood.\nI would run in, get a pint, and run out again, I thought. Then he\nwouldn\'t see the Golden Day. I seldom went there myself except with some of\nthe fellows when word got out that a new bunch of girls had arrived from\nNew Orleans. The school had tried to make the Golden Day respectable, but\nthe local white folks had a hand in it somehow and they got nowhere. The\nbest the school could do was to make it hot for any student caught going\nthere.\nHe lay like a man asleep as I left the car and ran into the Golden\nDay. I wanted to ask him for money but decided to use my own. At the door\nI paused; the place was already full, jammed with vets in loose gray shirts\nand trousers and women in short, tight-fitting, stiffly starched gingham\naprons. The stale beer smell struck like a club through the noise of voices\nand the juke box. Just as I got inside the door a stolid-faced man gripped\nme by the arm and looked stonily into my eyes.\n"It will occur at 5:30," he said, looking straight through me.\n"What?"\n"The great all-embracing, absolute Armistice, the end of the world!"\nhe said.\nBefore I could answer, a small plump woman smiled into my face\nand pulled him away.\n"It\'s your turn, Doc," she said. "Don\'t let it happen till after me and\nyou done been upstairs. How come I always have to come get you?"\n"No, it is true," he said. "They wirelessed me from Paris this\nmorning."\n"Then, baby, me an\' you better hurry. There\'s lots of money I got to\nmake in here before that thing happens. You hold it back a while, will you?"\nShe winked at me as she pulled him through the crowd toward the\nstairs. I elbowed my way nervously toward the bar.\nMany of the men had been doctors, lawyers, teachers, Civil Service\nworkers; there were several cooks, a preacher, a politician, and an artist. One\nvery nutty one had been a psychiatrist. Whenever I saw them I felt\nuncomfortable. They were supposed to be members of the professions toward\nwhich at various times I vaguely aspired myself, and even though they never\nseemed to see me I could never believe that they were really patients.\nSometimes it appeared as though they played some vast and complicated\ngame with me and the rest of the school folk, a game whose goal was\nlaughter and whose rules and subtleties I could never grasp.\nTwo men stood directly in front of me, one speaking with intense\nearnestness. ". . . and Johnson hit Jeffries at an angle of 45 degrees from his\nlower left lateral incisor, producing an instantaneous blocking of his entire\nthalamic rine, frosting it over like the freezing unit of a refrigerator, thus\nshattering his autonomous nervous system and rocking the big brick-laying\ncreampuff with extreme hyperspasmic muscular tremors which dropped him\ndead on the extreme tip of his coccyx, which, in turn, produced a sharp\ntraumatic reaction in his sphincter nerve and muscle, and then, my dear\ncolleague, they swept him up, sprinkled him with quicklime and rolled him\naway in a barrow. Naturally, there was no other therapy possible."\n"Excuse me," I said, pushing past.\nBig Halley was behind the bar, his dark skin showing through his\nsweat-wet shirt.\n"Whatcha saying, school-boy?"\n"I want a double whiskey, Halley. Put it in something deep so I can\nget it out of here without spilling it. It\'s for somebody outside."\nHis mouth shot out, "Hell, naw!"\n"Why?" I asked, surprised at the anger in his thyroid eyes.\n"You still up at the school, ain\'t you?"\n"Sure."\n"Well, those bastards is trying to close me up agin, that\'s why. You\ncan drink till you blue in the face in here, but I wouldn\'t sell you enough to\nspit through your teeth to take outside."\n"But I\'ve got a sick man out in the car."\n"What car? You never had no car."\n"The white man\'s car. I\'m driving for him."\n"Ain\'t you in school?"\n"He\'s from the school."\n"Well, who\'s sick?"\n"He is."\n"He too good to come in? Tell him we don\'t Jimcrow nobody."\n"But he\'s sick."\n"He can die!"\n"He\'s important, Halley, a trustee. He\'s rich and sick and if anything\nhappens to him, they\'ll have me packed and on my way home."\n"Can\'t help it, school-boy. Bring him inside and he can buy enough\nto swim in. He can drink outta my own private bottle."\nHe sliced the white heads off a couple of beers with an ivory paddle\nand passed them up the bar. I felt sick inside. Mr. Norton wouldn\'t want to\ncome in here. He was too sick. And besides I didn\'t want him to see the\npatients and the girls. Things were getting wilder as I made my way out.\nSupercargo, the white-uniformed attendant who usually kept the men quiet\nwas nowhere to be seen. I didn\'t like it, for when he was upstairs they had\nabsolutely no inhibitions. I made my way out to the car. What could I tell\nMr. Norton? He was lying very still when I opened the door.\n"Mr. Norton, sir. They refuse to sell me whiskey to bring out."\nHe lay very still.\n"Mr. Norton."\nHe lay like a figure of chalk. I shook him gently, feeling dread within\nme. He barely breathed. I shook him violently, seeing his head wobble\ngrotesquely. His lips parted, bluish, revealing a row of long, slender,\namazingly animal-like teeth.\n"SIR!"\nIn a panic I ran back into the Golden Day, bursting through the\nnoise as through an invisible wall.\n"Halley! Help me, he\'s dying!"\nI tried to get through but no one seemed to have heard me. I was\nblocked on both sides. They were jammed together.\n"Halley!"\nTwo patients turned and looked me in the face, their eyes two inches\nfrom my nose.\n"What is wrong with this gentleman, Sylvester?" the tall one said.\n"A man\'s dying outside!" I said.\n"Someone is always dying," the other one said.\n"Yes, and it\'s good to die beneath God\'s great tent of sky."\n"He\'s got to have some whiskey!"\n"Oh, that\'s different," one of them said and they began pushing a\npath to the bar. "A last bright drink to keep the anguish down. Step aside,\nplease!"\n"School-boy, you back already?" Halley said.\n"Give me some whiskey. He\'s dying!"\n"I done told you, school-boy, you better bring him in here. He can\ndie, but I still got to pay my bills."\n"Please, they\'ll put me in jail."\n"You going to college, figure it out," he said.\n"You\'d better bring the gentleman inside," the one called Sylvester\nsaid. "Come, let us assist you."\nWe fought our way out of the crowd. He was just as I left him.\n"Look, Sylvester, it\'s Thomas Jefferson!"\n"I was just about to say, I\'ve long wanted to discourse with him."\nI looked at them speechlessly; they were both crazy. Or were they\njoking?\n"Give me a hand," I said.\n"Gladly."\nI shook him. "Mr. Norton!"\n"We\'d better hurry if he\'s to enjoy his drink," one of them said\nthoughtfully.\nWe picked him up. He swung between us like a sack of old clothes.\n"Hurry!"\nAs we carried him toward the Golden Day one of the men stopped\nsuddenly and Mr. Norton\'s head hung down, his white hair dragging in the\ndust.\n"Gentlemen, this man is my grandfather!"\n"But he\'s white, his name\'s Norton."\n"I should know my own grandfather! He\'s Thomas Jefferson and I\'m\nhis grandson -- on the \'field-nigger\' side," the tall man said.\n"Sylvester, I do believe that you\'re right. I certainly do," he said,\nstaring at Mr. Norton. "Look at those features. Exactly like yours -- from the\nidentical mold. Are you sure he didn\'t spit you upon the earth, fully clothed?"\n"No, no, that was my father," the man said earnestly.\nAnd he began to curse his father violently as we moved for the door.\nHalley was there waiting. Somehow he\'d gotten the crowd to quiet down and\na space was cleared in the center of the room. The men came close to look\nat Mr. Norton.\n"Somebody bring a chair."\n"Yeah, let Mister Eddy sit down."\n"That ain\'t no Mister Eddy, man, that\'s John D. Rockefeller,"\nsomeone said.\n"Here\'s a chair for the Messiah."\n"Stand back y\'all," Halley ordered. "Give him some room."\nBurnside, who had been a doctor, rushed forward and felt for Mr.\nNorton\'s pulse.\n"It\'s solid! This man has a solid pulse! Instead of beating, it vibrates.\nThat\'s very unusual. Very."\nSomeone pulled him away. Halley reappeared with a bottle and a\nglass. "Here, some of y\'all tilt his head back."\nAnd before I could move, a short, pock-marked man appeared and\ntook Mr. Norton\'s head between his hands, tilting it at arm\'s length and then,\npinching the chin gently like a barber about to apply a razor, gave a sharp,\nswift movement.\n"Pow!"\nMr. Norton\'s head jerked like a jabbed punching bag. Five pale red\nlines bloomed on the white cheek, glowing like fire beneath translucent stone.\nI could not believe my eyes. I wanted to run. A woman tittered. I saw several\nmen rush for the door.\n"Cut it out, you damn fool!"\n"A case of hysteria," the pock-marked man said quietly.\n"Git the hell out of the way," Halley said. "Somebody git that\nstool-pigeon attendant from upstairs. Git him down here, quick!"\n"A mere mild case of hysteria," the pock-marked man said as they\npushed him away.\n"Hurry with the drink, Halley!"\n"Heah, school-boy, you hold the glass. This here\'s brandy I been\nsaving for myself."\nSomeone whispered tonelessly into my ear, "You see, I told you that\nit would occur at 5:30. Already the Creator has come." It was the stolid-faced\nman.\nI saw Halley tilt the bottle and the oily amber of brandy sloshing\ninto the glass. Then tilting Mr. Norton\'s head back, I put the glass to his lips\nand poured. A fine brown stream ran from the corner of his mouth, down his\ndelicate chin. The room was suddenly quiet. I felt a slight movement against\nmy hand, like a child\'s breast when it whimpers at the end of a spell of\ncrying. The fine-veined eyelids flickered. He coughed. I saw a slow red flush\ncreep, then spurt, up his neck, spreading over his face.\n"Hold it under his nose, school-boy. Let \'im smell it."\nI waved the glass beneath Mr. Norton\'s nose. He opened his pale\nblue eyes. They seemed watery now in the red flush that bathed his face. He\ntried to sit up, his right hand fluttering to his chin. His eyes widened, moved\nquickly from face to face. Then coming to mine, the moist eyes focused with\nrecognition.\n"You were unconscious, sir," I said.\n"Where am I, young man?" he asked wearily.\n"This is the Golden Day, sir."\n"What?"\n"The Golden Day. It\'s a kind of sporting-and-gambling house," I\nadded reluctantly.\n"Now give him another drinka brandy," Halley said.\nI poured a drink and handed it to him. He sniffed it, closed his eyes\nas in puzzlement, then drank; his cheeks filled out like small bellows; he was\nrinsing his mouth.\n"Thank you," he said, a little stronger now. "What is this place?"\n"The Golden Day," said several patients in unison.\nHe looked slowly around him, up to the balcony, with its scrolled\nand carved wood. A large flag hung lank above the floor. He frowned.\n"What was this building used for in the past?" he said.\n"It was a church, then a bank, then it was a restaurant and a fancy\ngambling house, and now we got it," Halley explained. "I think somebody said\nit used to be a jail-house too."\n"They let us come here once a week to raise a little hell," someone\nsaid.\n"I couldn\'t buy a drink to take out, sir, so I had to bring you\ninside," I explained in dread.\nHe looked about him. I followed his eyes and was amazed to see the\nvaried expressions on the patients\' faces as they silently returned his gaze.\nSome were hostile, some cringing, some horrified; some, who when among\nthemselves were most violent, now appeared as submissive as children. And\nsome seemed strangely amused.\n"Are all of you patients?" Mr. Norton asked.\n"Me, I just runs the joint," Halley said. "These here other fellows . .\n."\n"We\'re patients sent here as therapy," a short, fat, very\nintelligent-looking man said. "But," he smiled, "they send along an attendant,\na kind of censor, to see that the therapy fails."\n"You\'re nuts. I\'m a dynamo of energy. I come to charge my\nbatteries," one of the vets insisted.\n"I\'m a student of history, sir," another interrupted with dramatic\ngestures. "The world moves in a circle like a roulette wheel. In the beginning,\nblack is on top, in the middle epochs, white holds the odds, but soon\nEthiopia shall stretch forth her noble wings! Then place your money on the\nblack!" His voice throbbed with emotion. "Until then, the sun holds no heat,\nthere\'s ice in the heart of the earth. Two years from now and I\'ll be old\nenough to give my mulatto mother a bath, the half-white bitch!" he added,\nbeginning to leap up and down in an explosion of glassy-eyed fury.\nMr. Norton blinked his eyes and straightened up.\n"I\'m a physician, may I take your pulse?" Burnside said, seizing Mr.\nNorton\'s wrist.\n"Don\'t pay him no mind, mister. He ain\'t been no doctor in ten\nyears. They caught him trying to change some blood into money."\n"I did too!" the man screamed. "I discovered it and John D.\nRockefeller stole the formula from me."\n"Mr. Rockefeller did you say?" Mr. Norton said. "I\'m sure you must\nbe mistaken."\n"WHAT\'S GOING ON DOWN THERE?" a voice shouted from the\nbalcony. Everyone turned. I saw a huge black giant of a man, dressed only in\nwhite shorts, swaying on the stairs. It was Supercargo, the attendant. I hardly\nrecognized him without his hard-starched white uniform. Usually he walked\naround threatening the men with a strait jacket which he always carried over\nhis arm, and usually they were quiet and submissive in his presence. But now\nthey seemed not to recognize him and began shouting curses.\n"How you gon keep order in the place if you gon git drunk?" Halley\nshouted. "Charlene! Charlene!"\n"Yeah?" a woman\'s voice, startling in its carrying power, answered\nsulkily from a room off the balcony.\n"I want you to git that stool-pigeoning, joy-killing, nut-crushing bum\nback in there with you and sober him up. Then git him in his white suit and\ndown here to keep order. We got white folks in the house."\nA woman appeared on the balcony, drawing a woolly pink robe about\nher. "Now you lissen here, Halley," she drawled, "I\'m a woman. If you want\nhim dressed, you can do it yourself. I don\'t put on but one man\'s clothes\nand he\'s in N\'Orleans."\n"Never mind all that. Git that stool pigeon sober!"\n"I want order down there," Supercargo boomed, "and if there\'s white\nfolks down there, I wan\'s double order."\nSuddenly there was an angry roar from the men back near the bar\nand I saw them rush the stairs.\n"Get him!"\n"Let\'s give him some order!"\n"Out of my way."\nFive men charged the stairs. I saw the giant bend and clutch the\nposts at the top of the stairs with both hands, bracing himself, his body\ngleaming bare in his white shorts. The little man who had slapped Mr.\nNorton was in front, and, as he sprang up the long flight, I saw the\nattendant set himself and kick, catching the little man just as he reached the\ntop, hard in the chest, sending him backwards in a curving dive into the\nmidst of the men behind him. Supercargo got set to swing his leg again. It\nwas a narrow stair and only one man could get up at a time. As fast as they\nrushed up, the giant kicked them back. He swung his leg, kicking them down\nlike a fungo-hitter batting out flies. Watching him, I forgot Mr. Norton. The\nGolden Day was in an uproar. Half-dressed women appeared from the rooms\noff the balcony. Men hooted and yelled as at a football game.\n"I WANT ORDER!" the giant shouted as he sent a man flying down\nthe flight of stairs.\n"THEY THROWING BOTTLES OF LIQUOR!" a woman screamed.\n"REAL LIQUOR!"\n"That\'s a order he don\'t want," someone said.\nA shower of bottles and glasses splashing whiskey crashed against the\nbalcony. I saw Supercargo snap suddenly erect and grab his forehead, his face\nbathed in whiskey, "Eeeee!" he cried, "Eeeee!" Then I saw him waver, rigid\nfrom his ankles upward. For a moment the men on the stairs were\nmotionless, watching him. Then they sprang forward.\nSupercargo grabbed wildly at the balustrade as they snatched his feet\nfrom beneath him and started down. His head bounced against the steps\nmaking a sound like a series of gunshots as they ran dragging him by his\nankles, like volunteer firemen running with a hose. The crowd surged forward.\nHalley yelled near my ear. I saw the man being dragged toward the center of\nthe room.\n"Give the bastard some order!"\n"Here I\'m forty-five and he\'s been acting like he\'s my old man!"\n"So you like to kick, huh?" a tall man said, aiming a shoe at the\nattendant\'s head. The flesh above his right eye jumped out as though it had\nbeen inflated.\nThen I heard Mr. Norton beside me shouting, "No, no! Not when\nhe\'s down!"\n"Lissen at the white folks," someone said. "He\'s the white folks\'\nman!"\nMen were jumping upon Supercargo with both feet now and I felt\nsuch an excitement that I wanted to join them. Even the girls were yelling,\n"Give it to him good!" "He never pays me!" "Kill him!"\n"Please, y\'all, not here! Not in my place!"\n"You can\'t speak your mind when he\'s on duty!"\n"Hell, no!"\nSomehow I got pushed away from Mr. Norton and found myself\nbeside the man called Sylvester.\n"Watch this, school-boy," he said. "See there, where his ribs are\nbleeding?" I nodded my head. "Now don\'t move your eyes."\nI watched the spot as though compelled, just beneath the lower rib\nand above the hip-bone, as Sylvester measured carefully with his toe and\nkicked as though he were punting a football. Supercargo let out a groan like\nan injured horse.\n"Try it, school-boy, it feels so good. It gives you relief," Sylvester\nsaid. "Sometimes I get so afraid of him I feel that he\'s inside my head.\nThere!" he said, giving Supercargo another kick.\nAs I watched, a man sprang on Supercargo\'s chest with both feet and\nhe lost consciousness. They began throwing cold beer on him, reviving him,\nonly to kick him unconscious again. Soon he was drenched in blood and beer.\n"The bastard\'s out cold."\n"Throw him out."\n"Naw, wait a minute. Give me a hand somebody."\nThey threw him upon the bar, stretching him out with his arms\nfolded across his chest like a corpse.\n"Now, let\'s have a drink!"\nHalley was slow in getting behind the bar and they cursed him.\n"Get back there and serve us, you big sack of fat!"\n"Gimme a rye!"\n"Up here, funk-buster!"\n"Shake them sloppy hips!"\n"Okay, okay, take it easy," Halley said, rushing to pour them drinks.\n"Just put y\'all\'s money where your mouth is."\nWith Supercargo lying helpless upon the bar, the men whirled about\nlike maniacs. The excitement seemed to have tilted some of the more\ndelicately balanced ones too far. Some made hostile speeches at the top of\ntheir voices against the hospital, the state and the universe. The one who\ncalled himself a composer was banging away the one wild piece he seemed to\nknow on the out-of-tune piano, striking the keyboard with fists and elbows\nand filling in other effects in a bass voice that moaned like a bear in agony.\nOne of the most educated ones touched my arm. He was a former chemist\nwho was never seen without his shining Phi Beta Kappa key.\n"The men have lost control," he said through the uproar. "I think\nyou\'d better leave."\n"I\'m trying to," I said, "as soon as I can get over to Mr. Norton."\nMr. Norton was gone from where I had left him. I rushed here and\nthere through the noisy men, calling his name.\nWhen I found him he was under the stairs. Somehow he had been\npushed there by the scuffling, reeling men and he lay sprawled in the chair\nlike an aged doll. In the dim light his features were sharp and white and his\nclosed eyes well-defined lines in a well-tooled face. I shouted his name above\nthe roar of the men, and got no answer. He was out again. I shook him,\ngently, then roughly, but still no flicker of his wrinkled lids. Then some of\nthe milling men pushed me up against him and suddenly a mass of whiteness\nwas looming two inches from my eyes; it was only his face but I felt a\nshudder of nameless horror. I had never been so close to a white person\nbefore. In a panic I struggled to get away. With his eyes closed he seemed\nmore threatening than with them open. He was like a formless white death,\nsuddenly appeared before me, a death which had been there all the time and\nwhich had now revealed itself in the madness of the Golden Day.\n"Stop screaming!" a voice commanded, and I felt myself pulled away.\nIt was the short fat man.\nI clamped my mouth shut, aware for the first time that the shrill\nsound was coming from my own throat. I saw the man\'s face relax as he\ngave me a wry smile.\n"That\'s better," he shouted into my ear. "He\'s only a man. Remember\nthat. He\'s only a man!"\nI wanted to tell him that Mr. Norton was much more than that, that\nhe was a rich white man and in my charge; but the very idea that I was\nresponsible for him was too much for me to put into words.\n"Let us take him to the balcony," the man said, pushing me toward\nMr. Norton\'s feet. I moved automatically, grasping the thin ankles as he\nraised the white man by the armpits and backed from beneath the stairs. Mr.\nNorton\'s head lolled upon his chest as though he were drunk or dead.\nThe vet started up the steps still smiling, climbing backwards a step\nat a time. I had begun to worry about him, whether he was drunk like the\nrest, when I saw three of the girls who had been leaning over the balustrade\nwatching the brawl come down to help us carry Mr. Norton up.\n"Looks like pops couldn\'t take it," one of them shouted.\n"He\'s high as a Georgia pine."\n"Yeah, I tell you this stuff Halley got out here is too strong for white\nfolks to drink."\n"Not drunk, ill!" the fat man said. "Go find a bed that\'s not being\nused so he can stretch out awhile."\n"Sho, daddy. Is there any other little favors I can do for you?"\n"That\'ll be enough," he said.\nOne of the girls ran up ahead. "Mine\'s just been changed. Bring him\ndown here," she said.\nIn a few minutes Mr. Norton was lying upon a three-quarter bed,\nfaintly breathing. I watched the fat man bend over him very professionally\nand feel for his pulse.\n"You a doctor?" a girl asked.\n"Not now, I\'m a patient. But I have a certain knowledge."\nAnother one, I thought, pushing him quickly aside. "He\'ll be all right.\nLet him come to so I can get him out of here."\n"You needn\'t worry, I\'m not like those down there, young fellow," he\nsaid. "I really was a doctor. I won\'t hurt him. He\'s had a mild shock of some\nkind."\nWe watched him bend over Mr. Norton again, feeling his pulse,\npulling back his eyelid.\n"It\'s a mild shock," he repeated.\n"This here Golden Day is enough to shock anybody," a girl said,\nsmoothing her apron over the smooth sensuous roll of her stomach.\nAnother brushed Mr. Norton\'s white hair away from his forehead and\nstroked it, smiling vacantly. "He\'s kinda cute," she said. "Just like a little\nwhite baby."\n"What kinda ole baby?" the small skinny girl asked.\n"That\'s the kind, an ole baby."\n"You just like white men, Edna. That\'s all," the skinny one said.\nEdna shook her head and smiled as though amused at herself. "I sho\ndo. I just love \'em. Now this one, old as he is, he could put his shoes under\nmy bed any night."\n"Shucks, me I\'d kill an old man like that."\n"Kill him nothing," Edna said. "Girl, don\'t you know that all these\nrich ole white men got monkey glands and billy goat balls? These ole\nbastards don\'t never git enough. They want to have the whole world."\nThe doctor looked at me and smiled. "See, now you\'re learning all\nabout endocrinology," he said. "I was wrong when I told you that he was\nonly a man; it seems now that he\'s either part goat or part ape. Maybe he\'s\nboth."\n"It\'s the truth," Edna said. "I used to have me one in Chicago --"\n"Now you ain\'t never been to no Chicago, gal," the other one\ninterrupted.\n"How you know I ain\'t? Two years ago . . . Shucks, you don\'t know\nnothing. That ole white man right there might have him a coupla jackass\nballs!"\nThe fat man raised up with a quick grin. "As a scientist and a\nphysician I\'m forced to discount that," he said. "That is one operation that\nhas yet to be performed." Then he managed to get the girls out of the room.\n"If he should come around and hear that conversation," the vet said,\n"it would be enough to send him off again. Besides, their scientific curiosity\nmight lead them to investigate whether he really does have a monkey gland.\nAnd that, I\'m afraid, would be a bit obscene."\n"I\'ve got to get him back to the school," I said.\n"All right," he said, "I\'ll do what I can to help you. Go see if you\ncan find some ice. And don\'t worry."\nI went out on the balcony, seeing the tops of their heads. They were\nstill milling around, the juke box baying, the piano thumping, and over at the\nend of the room, drenched with beer, Supercargo lay like a spent horse upon\nthe bar.\nStarting down, I noticed a large piece of ice glinting in the remains\nof an abandoned drink and seized its coldness in my hot hand and hurried\nback to the room.\nThe vet sat staring at Mr. Norton, who now breathed with a slightly\nirregular sound.\n"You were quick," the man said, as he stood and reached for the ice.\n"Swift with the speed of anxiety," he added, as if to himself. "Hand me that\nclean towel -- there, from beside the basin."\nI handed him one, seeing him fold the ice inside it and apply it to\nMr. Norton\'s face.\n"Is he all right?" I said.\n"He will be in a few minutes. What happened to him?"\n"I took him for a drive," I said.\n"Did you have an accident or something?"\n"No," I said. "He just talked to a farmer and the heat knocked him\nout . . . Then we got caught in the mob downstairs."\n"How old is he?"\n"I don\'t know, but he\'s one of the trustees . . ."\n"One of the very first, no doubt," he said, dabbing at the blue-veined\neyes. "A trustee of consciousness."\n"What was that?" I asked.\n"Nothing . . . There now, he\'s coming out of it."\nI had an impulse to run out of the room. I feared what Mr. Norton\nwould say to me, the expression that might come into his eyes. And yet, I\nwas afraid to leave. My eyes could not leave the face with its flickering lids.\nThe head moved from side to side in the pale glow of the light bulb, as\nthough denying some insistent voice which I could not hear. Then the lids\nopened, revealing pale pools of blue vagueness that finally solidified into\npoints that froze upon the vet, who looked down unsmilingly.\nMen like us did not look at a man like Mr. Norton in that manner,\nand I stepped hurriedly forward.\n"He\'s a real doctor, sir," I said.\n"I\'ll explain," the vet said. "Get a glass of water."\nI hesitated. He looked at me firmly. "Get the water," he said, turning\nto help Mr. Norton to sit up.\nOutside I asked Edna for a glass of water and she led me down the\nhall to a small kitchen, drawing it for me from a green old-fashioned cooler.\n"I got some good liquor, baby, if you want to give him a drink," she\nsaid.\n"This will do," I said. My hands trembled so that the water spilled.\nWhen I returned, Mr. Norton was sitting up unaided, carrying on a\nconversation with the vet.\n"Here\'s some water, sir," I said, extending the glass.\nHe took it. "Thank you," he said.\n"Not too much," the vet cautioned.\n"Your diagnosis is exactly that of my specialist," Mr. Norton said,\n"and I went to several fine physicians before one could diagnose it. How did\nyou know?"\n"I too was a specialist," the vet said.\n"But how? Only a few men in the whole country possess the\nknowledge --"\n"Then one of them is an inmate of a semi-madhouse," the vet said.\n"But there\'s nothing mysterious about it. I escaped for a while -- I went to\nFrance with the Army Medical Corps and remained there after the Armistice\nto study and practice."\n"Oh yes, and how long were you in France?" Mr. Norton asked.\n"Long enough," he said. "Long enough to forget some fundamentals\nwhich I should never have forgotten."\n"What fundamentals?" Mr. Norton said. "What do you mean?"\nThe vet smiled and cocked his head. "Things about life. Such things\nas most peasants and folk peoples almost always know through experience,\nthough seldom through conscious thought . . ."\n"Pardon me, sir," I said to Mr. Norton, "but now that you feel better,\nshouldn\'t we go?"\n"Not just yet," he said. Then to the doctor, "I\'m very interested.\nWhat happened to you?" A drop of water caught in one of his eyebrows\nglittered like a chip of active diamond. I went over and sat on a chair. Damn\nthis vet to hell!\n"Are you sure you would like to hear?" the vet asked.\n"Why, of course."\n"Then perhaps the young fellow should go downstairs and wait . . ."\nThe sound of shouting and destruction welled up from below as I\nopened the door.\n"No, perhaps you should stay," the fat man said. "Perhaps had I\noverheard some of what I\'m about to tell you when I was a student up there\non the hill, I wouldn\'t be the casualty that I am."\n"Sit down, young man," Mr. Norton ordered. "So you were a student\nat the college," he said to the vet.\nI sat down again, worrying about Dr. Bledsoe as the fat man told\nMr. Norton of his attending college, then becoming a physician and going to\nFrance during the World War.\n"Were you a successful physician?" Mr. Norton said.\n"Fairly so. I performed a few brain surgeries that won me some\nsmall attention."\n"Then why did you return?"\n"Nostalgia," the vet said.\n"Then what on earth are you doing here in this . . . ?" Mr. Norton\nsaid, "With your ability . . ."\n"Ulcers," the fat man said.\n"That\'s terribly unfortunate, but why should ulcers stop your career?"\n"Not really, but I learned along with the ulcers that my work could\nbring me no dignity," the vet said.\n"Now you sound bitter," Mr. Norton said, just as the door flew open.\nA brown-skinned woman with red hair looked in. "How\'s white-folks\nmaking out?" she said, staggering inside. "White-folks, baby, you done come\nto. You want a drink?"\n"Not now, Hester," the vet said. "He\'s still a little weak."\n"He sho looks it. That\'s how come he needs a drink. Put some iron\nin his blood."\n"Now, now, Hester."\n"Okay, okay . . . But what y\'all doing looking like you at a funeral?\nDon\'t you know this is the Golden Day?" she staggered toward me, belching\nelegantly and reeling. "Just look at y\'all. Here school-boy looks like he\'s\nscared to death. And white-folks here is acting like y\'all two strange poodles.\nBe happy y\'all! I\'m going down and get Halley to send you up some drinks."\nShe patted Mr. Norton\'s cheek as she went past and I saw him turn a\nglowing red. "Be happy, white-folks."\n"Ah hah!" the vet laughed, "you\'re blushing, which means that you\'re\nbetter. Don\'t be embarrassed. Hester is a great humanitarian, a therapist of\ngenerous nature and great skill, and the possessor of a healing touch. Her\ncatharsis is absolutely tremendous -- ha, ha!"\n"You do look better, sir," I said, anxious to get out of the place. I\ncould understand the vet\'s words but not what they conveyed, and Mr.\nNorton looked as uncomfortable as I felt. The one thing which I did know\nwas that the vet was acting toward the white man with a freedom which\ncould only bring on trouble. I wanted to tell Mr. Norton that the man was\ncrazy and yet I received a fearful satisfaction from hearing him talk as he\nhad to a white man. With the girl it was different. A woman usually got\naway with things a man never could.\nI was wet with anxiety, but the vet talked on, ignoring the\ninterruption.\n"Rest, rest," he said, fixing Mr. Norton with his eyes. "The clocks are\nall set back and the forces of destruction are rampant down below. They\nmight suddenly realize that you are what you are, and then your life wouldn\'t\nbe worth a piece of bankrupt stock. You would be canceled, perforated,\nvoided, become the recognized magnet attracting loose screws. Then what\nwould you do? Such men are beyond money, and with Supercargo down, out\nlike a felled ox, they know nothing of value. To some, you are the great\nwhite father, to others the lyncher of souls, but for all, you are confusion\ncome even into the Golden Day."\n"What are you talking about?" I said, thinking: Lyncher? He was\ngetting wilder than the men downstairs. I didn\'t dare look at Mr. Norton,\nwho made a sound of protest.\nThe vet frowned. "It is an issue which I can confront only by\nevading it. An utterly stupid proposition, and these hands so lovingly trained\nto master a scalpel yearn to caress a trigger. I returned to save life and I\nwas refused," he said. "Ten men in masks drove me out from the city at\nmidnight and beat me with whips for saving a human life. And I was forced\nto the utmost degradation because I possessed skilled hands and the belief\nthat my knowledge could bring me dignity -- not wealth, only dignity -- and\nother men health!"\nThen suddenly he fixed me with his eyes. "And now, do you\nunderstand?"\n"What?" I said.\n"What you\'ve heard!"\n"I don\'t know."\n"Why?"\nI said, "I really think it\'s time we left."\n"You see," he said turning to Mr. Norton, "he has eyes and ears and\na good distended African nose, but he fails to understand the simple facts of\nlife. Understand. Understand? It\'s worse than that. He registers with his\nsenses but short-circuits his brain. Nothing has meaning. He takes it in but\nhe doesn\'t digest it. Already he is -- well, bless my soul! Behold! a walking\nzombie! Already he\'s learned to repress not only his emotions but his\nhumanity. He\'s invisible, a walking personification of the Negative, the most\nperfect achievement of your dreams, sir! The mechanical man!"\nMr. Norton looked amazed.\n"Tell me," the vet said, suddenly calm. "Why have you been\ninterested in the school, Mr. Norton?"\n"Out of a sense of my destined role," Mr. Norton said shakily. "I felt,\nand I still feel, that your people are in some important manner tied to my\ndestiny."\n"What do you mean, destiny?" the vet said.\n"Why, the success of my work, of course."\n"I see. And would you recognize it if you saw it?"\n"Why, of course I would," Mr. Norton said indignantly. "I\'ve watched\nit grow each year I\'ve returned to the campus."\n"Campus? Why the campus?"\n"It is there that my destiny is being made."\nThe vet exploded with laughter. "The campus, what a destiny!" He\nstood and walked around the narrow room, laughing. Then he stopped as\nsuddenly as he had begun.\n"You will hardly recognize it, but it is very fitting that you came to\nthe Golden Day with the young fellow," he said.\n"I came out of illness -- or rather, he brought me," Mr. Norton said.\n"Of course, but you came, and it was fitting."\n"What do you mean?" Mr. Norton said with irritation.\n"A little child shall lead them," the vet said with a smile. "But\nseriously, because you both fail to understand what is happening to you. You\ncannot see or hear or smell the truth of what you see -- and you, looking for\ndestiny! It\'s classic! And the boy, this automaton, he was made of the very\nmud of the region and he sees far less than you. Poor stumblers, neither of\nyou can see the other. To you he is a mark on the score-card of your\nachievement, a thing and not a man; a child, or even less -- a black\namorphous thing. And you, for all your power, are not a man to him, but a\nGod, a force --"\nMr. Norton stood abruptly. "Let us go, young man," he said angrily.\n"No, listen. He believes in you as he believes in the beat of his\nheart. He believes in that great false wisdom taught slaves and pragmatists\nalike, that white is right. I can tell you his destiny. He\'ll do your bidding,\nand for that his blindness is his chief asset. He\'s your man, friend. Your man\nand your destiny. Now the two of you descend the stairs into chaos and get\nthe hell out of here. I\'m sick of both of you pitiful obscenities! Get out before\nI do you both the favor of bashing in your heads!"\nI saw his motion toward the big white pitcher on the washstand and\nstepped between him and Mr. Norton, guiding Mr. Norton swiftly through the\ndoorway. Looking back, I saw him leaning against the wall making a sound\nthat was a blending of laughter and tears.\n"Hurry, the man is as insane as the rest," Mr. Norton said.\n"Yes, sir," I said, noticing a new note in his voice.\nThe balcony was now as noisy as the floor below. The girls and\ndrunken vets were stumbling about with drinks in their hands. Just as we\nwent past an open door Edna saw us and grabbed my arm.\n"Where you taking white-folks?" she demanded.\n"Back to school," I said, shaking her off.\n"You don\'t want to go up there, white-folks, baby," she said. I tried\nto push past her. "I ain\'t lying," she said. "I\'m the best little home-maker in\nthe business."\n"Okay, but please let us alone," I pleaded. "You\'ll get me into\ntrouble."\nWe were going down the stairs into the milling men now and she\nstarted to scream, "Pay me then! If he\'s too good for me, let him pay!"\nAnd before I could stop her she had pushed Mr. Norton, and both of\nus were stumbling swiftly down the stairs. I landed against a man who\nlooked up with the anonymous familiarity of a drunk and shoved me hard\naway. I saw Mr. Norton spin past as I sank farther into the crowd.\nSomewhere I could hear the girl screaming and Halley\'s voice yelling, "Hey!\nHey! Hey, now!" Then I was aware of fresh air and saw that I was near the\ndoor and pushed my way free and stood panting and preparing to plunge\nback for Mr. Norton -- when I heard Halley calling, "Make way y\'all!" and\nsaw him piloting Mr. Norton to the door.\n"Whew!" he said, releasing the white man and shaking his huge head.\n"Thanks, Halley --" I said and got no further.\nI saw Mr. Norton, his face pale again, his white suit rumpled, topple\nand fall, his head scraping against the screen of the door.\n"Hey!"\nI opened the door and raised him up.\n"Goddamit, out agin," Halley said. "How come you bring this white\nman here, school-boy?"\n"Is he dead?"\n"DEAD!" he said, stepping back indignantly. "He caint die!"\n"What\'ll I do, Halley?"\n"Not in my place, he caint die," he said, kneeling.\nMr. Norton looked up. "No one is dead or dying," he said acidly.\n"Remove your hands!"\nHalley fell away, surprised. "I sho am glad. You sho you all right? I\nthought sho you was dead this time."\n"For God\'s sake, be quiet!" I exploded nervously. "You should be glad\nthat he\'s all right."\nMr. Norton was visibly angry now, a raw place showing on his\nforehead, and I hurried ahead of him to the car. He climbed in unaided, and\nI got under the wheel, smelling the heated odor of mints and cigar smoke.\nHe was silent as I drove away.\nChapter 4\nThe wheel felt like an alien thing in my hands as I followed the\nwhite line of the highway. Heat rays from the late afternoon sun arose from\nthe gray concrete, shimmering like the weary tones of a distant bugle blown\nupon still midnight air. In the mirror I could see Mr. Norton staring out\nvacantly upon the empty fields, his mouth stern, his white forehead livid\nwhere it had scraped the screen. And seeing him I felt the fear balled coldly\nwithin me unfold. What would happen now? What would the school officials\nsay? In my mind I visualized Dr. Bledsoe\'s face when he saw Mr. Norton. I\nthought of the glee certain folks at home would feel if I were expelled.\nTatlock\'s grinning face danced through my mind. What would the white folks\nthink who\'d sent me to college? Was Mr. Norton angry at me? In the Golden\nDay he had seemed more curious than anything else -- until the vet had\nstarted talking wild. Damn Trueblood. It was his fault. If we hadn\'t sat in the\nsun so long Mr. Norton would not have needed whiskey and I wouldn\'t have\ngone to the Golden Day. And why would the vets act that way with a white\nman in the house?\nI headed the car through the red-brick campus gateposts with a sense\nof cold apprehension. Now even the rows of neat dormitories seemed to\nthreaten me, the rolling lawns appearing as hostile as the gray highway with\nits white dividing line. As of its own compulsion, the car slowed as we passed\nthe chapel with its low, sweeping eaves. The sun shone coolly through the\navenue of trees, dappling the curving drive. Students strolled through the\nshade, down a hill of tender grass toward the brick-red stretch of tennis\ncourts. Far beyond, players in whites showed sharp against the red of the\ncourts surrounded by grass, a gay vista washed by the sun. In the brief\ninterval I heard a cheer arise. My predicament struck me like a stab. I had a\nsense of losing control of the car and slammed on the brakes in the middle\nof the road, then apologized and drove on. Here within this quiet greenness I\npossessed the only identity I had ever known, and I was losing it. In this\nbrief moment of passage I became aware of the connection between these\nlawns and buildings and my hopes and dreams. I wanted to stop the car and\ntalk with Mr. Norton, to beg his pardon for what he had seen; to plead and\nshow him tears, unashamed tears like those of a child before his parent; to\ndenounce all we\'d seen and heard; to assure him that far from being like any\nof the people we had seen, I hated them, that I believed in the principles of\nthe Founder with all my heart and soul, and that I believed in his own\ngoodness and kindness in extending the hand of his benevolence to helping\nus poor, ignorant people out of the mire and darkness. I would do his\nbidding and teach others to rise up as he wished them to, teach them to be\nthrifty, decent, upright citizens, contributing to the welfare of all, shunning all\nbut the straight and narrow path that he and the Founder had stretched\nbefore us. If only he were not angry with me! If only he would give me\nanother chance!\nTears filled my eyes, and the walks and buildings flowed and froze\nfor a moment in mist, glittering as in winter when rain froze on the grass\nand foliage and turned the campus into a world of whiteness, weighting and\nbending both trees and bushes with fruit of crystal. Then in the twinkling of\nmy eyes, it was gone, and the here and now of heat and greenness returned.\nIf only I could make Mr. Norton understand what the school meant to me.\n"Shall I stop at your rooms, sir?" I said. "Or shall I take you to the\nadministration building? Dr. Bledsoe might be worried."\n"To my rooms, then bring Dr. Bledsoe to me," he answered tersely.\n"Yes, sir."\nIn the mirror I saw him dabbing gingerly at his forehead with a\ncrinkled handkerchief. "You\'d better send the school physician to me also," he\nsaid.\nI stopped the car in front of a small building with white pillars like\nthose of an old plantation manor house, got out and opened the door.\n"Mr. Norton, please, sir . . . I\'m sorry . . . I --"\nHe looked at me sternly, his eyes narrowed, saying nothing.\n"I didn\'t know . . . please . . ."\n"Send Dr. Bledsoe to me," he said, turning away and swinging up the\ngraveled path to the building.\nI got back into the car and drove slowly to the administration\nbuilding. A girl waved gaily as I passed, a bunch of violets in her hand. Two\nteachers in dark suits talked decorously beside a broken fountain.\nThe building was quiet. Going upstairs I visualized Dr. Bledsoe, with\nhis broad globular face that seemed to take its form from the fat pressing\nfrom the inside, which, as air pressing against the membrane of a balloon,\ngave it shape and buoyancy. "Old Bucket-head," some of the fellows called\nhim. I never had. He had been kind to me from the first, perhaps because of\nthe letters which the school superintendent had sent to him when I arrived.\nBut more than that, he was the example of everything I hoped to be:\nInfluential with wealthy men all over the country; consulted in matters\nconcerning the race; a leader of his people; the possessor of not one, but two\nCadillacs, a good salary and a soft, good-looking and creamy-complexioned\nwife. What was more, while black and bald and everything white folks poked\nfun at, he had achieved power and authority; had, while black and\nwrinkle-headed, made himself of more importance in the world than most\nSouthern white men. They could laugh at him but they couldn\'t ignore him.\n"He\'s been looking all over for you," the girl at the desk said.\nWhen I walked in he looked up from the telephone and said, "Never\nmind, he\'s here now," and hung up. "Where\'s Mr. Norton?" he demanded\nexcitedly. "Is he all right?"\n"Yes, sir. I left him at his rooms and came to drive you down. He\nwishes to see you."\n"Is anything wrong?" he said, getting up hurriedly and coming around\nthe desk. I hesitated.\n"Well, is there!"\nThe panicky beating of my heart seemed to blur my vision.\n"Not now, sir."\n"Now? What do you mean?"\n"Well, sir, he had some kind of fainting spell."\n"Aw, my God! I knew something was wrong. Why didn\'t you get in\ntouch with me?" He grabbed his black homburg, starting for the door. "Come\non!"\nI followed him, trying to explain. "He\'s all over it now, sir, and we\nwere too far away for me to phone . . ."\n"Why did you take him so far?" he said, moving with great bustling\nenergy.\n"But I drove him where he wanted to go, sir."\n"Where was that?"\n"Back of the slave-quarter section," I said with dread.\n"The quarters! Boy, are you a fool? Didn\'t you know better than to\ntake a trustee out there?"\n"He asked me to, sir."\nWe were going down the walk now, through the spring air, and he\nstopped to look at me with exasperation, as though I\'d suddenly told him\nblack was white.\n"Damn what he wants," he said, climbing in the front seat beside me.\n"Haven\'t you the sense God gave a dog? We take these white folks where we\nwant them to go, we show them what we want them to see. Don\'t you know\nthat? I thought you had some sense."\nReaching Rabb Hall, I stopped the car, weak with bewilderment.\n"Don\'t sit there," he said. "Come with me!"\nJust inside the building I got another shock. As we approached a\nmirror Dr. Bledsoe stopped and composed his angry face like a sculptor,\nmaking it a bland mask, leaving only the sparkle of his eyes to betray the\nemotion that I had seen only a moment before. He looked steadily at himself\nfor a moment; then we moved quietly down the silent hall and up the stairs.\nA co-ed sat at a graceful table stacked with magazines. Before a great\nwindow stood a large aquarium containing colored stones and a small replica\nof a feudal castle surrounded by goldfish that seemed to remain motionless\ndespite the fluttering of their lacy fins, a momentary motionful suspension of\ntime.\n"Is Mr. Norton in his room?" he said to the girl.\n"Yessir, Dr. Bledsoe, sir," she said. "He said to tell you to come in\nwhen you got here."\nPausing at the door I heard him clear his throat, then rap softly\nupon the panel with his fist.\n"Mr. Norton?" he said, his lips already a smile. And at the answer I\nfollowed him inside.\nIt was a large light room. Mr. Norton sat in a huge wing chair with\nhis jacket off. A change of clothing lay on the cool bedspread. Above a\nspacious fireplace an oil portrait of the Founder looked down at me remotely,\nbenign, sad, and in that hot instant, profoundly disillusioned. Then a veil\nseemed to fall.\n"I\'ve been worried about you, sir," Dr. Bledsoe said. "We expected\nyou at the afternoon session . . ."\nNow it\'s beginning, I thought. Now --\nAnd suddenly he rushed forward. "Mr. Norton, your head!" he cried,\na strange grandmotherly concern in his voice. "What happened, sir?"\n"It\'s nothing." Mr. Norton\'s face was immobile. "A mere scratch."\nDr. Bledsoe whirled around, his face outraged. "Get the doctor over\nhere," he said. "Why didn\'t you tell me that Mr. Norton had been injured?"\n"I\'ve already taken care of that, sir," I said softly, seeing him whirl\nback.\n"Mr. Norton, Mister Norton! I\'m so sorry," he crooned. "I thought I\nhad sent you a boy who was careful, a sensible young man! Why we\'ve never\nhad an accident before. Never, not in seventy-five years. I assure you, sir,\nthat he shall be disciplined, severely disciplined!"\n"But there was no automobile accident," Mr. Norton said kindly, "nor\nwas the boy responsible. You may send him away, we won\'t need him now."\nMy eyes suddenly filled. I felt a wave of gratitude at his words.\n"Don\'t be kind, sir," Dr. Bledsoe said. "You can\'t be soft with these\npeople. We mustn\'t pamper them. An accident to a guest of this college while\nhe is in the charge of a student is without question the student\'s fault. That\'s\none of our strictest rules!" Then to me: "Return to your dormitory and\nremain there until further notice!"\n"But it was out of my control, sir," I said, "just as Mr. Norton said .\n. ."\n"I\'ll explain, young man," Mr. Norton said with a half-smile.\n"Everything will be explained."\n"Thank you, sir," I said, seeing Dr. Bledsoe looking at me with no\nchange of expression.\n"On second thought," he said, "I want you to be in chapel this\nevening, understand me, sir?"\n"Yes, sir."\nI opened the door with a cold hand, bumping into the girl who had\nbeen at the table when we went inside.\n"I\'m sorry," she said. "Looks like you have old Bucket-head kind of\nmad."\nI said nothing as she walked beside me expectantly. A red sun cast\nits light upon the campus as I started for my dormitory.\n"Will you take a message to my boy friend for me?" she said.\n"Who is he?" I said, trying hard to conceal my tension and fear.\n"Jack Maston," she said.\n"Okay, he\'s in the room next to mine."\n"That\'s swell," she said with a big smile. "The dean put me on duty\nso I missed him this afternoon. Just tell him that I said the grass is green . .\n."\n"What?"\n"The grass is green. It\'s our secret code, he\'ll understand."\n"The grass is green," I said.\n"That\'s it. Thank you, lover," she said.\nI felt like cursing as I watched her hurrying back into the building,\nhearing her flat-heeled shoes crunching the graveled walk. Here she was\nplaying with some silly secret code at the very minute my fate for the resf of\nmy life was being decided. The grass was green and they\'d meet and she\'d be\nsent home pregnant, but even so, in less disgrace than I . . . If only I knew\nwhat they were saying about me . . . Suddenly I had an idea and ran after\nher, into the building and up the stairs.\nIn the hall, fine dust played in a shaft of sunlight, stirred by her\nhurried passing. But she had disappeared. I had thought to ask her to listen\nat the door and tell me what was said. I gave it up; if she were discovered,\nI\'d have that on my conscience too. Besides, I was ashamed for anyone to\nknow of my predicament, it was too stupid to be believed. Down the long\nlength of the wide hall I heard someone unseen skipping down the stairs\nsinging. A girl\'s sweet, hopeful voice. I left quietly and hurried to my dorm.\nI lay in my room with my eyes closed, trying to think. The tension\ngripped my insides. Then I heard someone coming up the hall and stiffened.\nHad they sent for me already? Nearby a door opened and closed, leaving me\nas tense as ever. To whom could I turn for help? I could think of no one.\nNo one to whom I could even explain what had happened at the Golden Day.\nEverything was upset inside me. And Dr. Bledsoe\'s attitude toward Mr.\nNorton was the most confusing of all. I dared not repeat what he\'d said, for\nfear that it would lessen my chances of remaining in school. It just wasn\'t\ntrue, I had misunderstood. He couldn\'t have said what I thought he had said.\nHadn\'t I seen him approach white visitors too often with his hat in hand,\nbowing humbly and respectfully? Hadn\'t he refused to eat in the dining hall\nwith white guests of the school, entering only after they had finished and\nthen refusing to sit down, but remaining standing, his hat in his hand, while\nhe addressed them eloquently, then leaving with a humble bow? Hadn\'t he,\nhadn\'t he? I had seen him too often as I peeped through the door between\nthe dining room and the kitchen, I myself. And wasn\'t his favorite spiritual\n"Live-a-Humble"? And in the chapel on Sunday evenings upon the platform,\nhadn\'t he always taught us to live content in our place in a thousand\nunambiguous words? He had and I had believed him. I had believed without\nquestion his illustrations of the good which came of following the Founder\'s\npath. It was my affirmation of life and they couldn\'t send me away for\nsomething I didn\'t do. They simply couldn\'t. But that vet! He was so crazy\nthat he corrupted sane men. He had tried to turn the world inside out,\ngoddamn him! He had made Mr. Norton angry. He had no right to talk to a\nwhite man as he had, not with me to take the punishment . . .\nSomeone shook me and I recoiled, my legs moist and trembling. It\nwas my roommate.\n"What the hell, roomy," he said. "Let\'s go to chow."\nI looked at his confident mug; he was going to be a farmer.\n"I don\'t have an appetite," I said with a sigh.\n"Okay now," he said, "you can try to kid me but don\'t say I didn\'t\nwake you."\n"No," I said.\n"Who\'re you expecting, a broad-butt gal with ballbearing hips?"\n"No," I said.\n"You\'d better stop that, roomy," he grinned. "It\'ll ruin your health,\nmake you a moron. You ought to take you a gal and show her how the\nmoon rises over all that green grass on the Founder\'s grave, man . . ."\n"Go to hell," I said.\nHe left laughing, opening the door to the sound of many footsteps\nfrom the hall: supper time. The sound of departing voices. Something of my\nlife seemed to retreat with them into a gray distance, moiling. Then a knock\nsounded at the door and I sprang up, my heart tense.\nA small student wearing a freshman\'s cap stuck his head in the door,\nshouting, "Dr. Bledsoe said he wants to see you down at Rabb Hall." And\nthen he was gone before I could question him, his footsteps thundering down\nthe hall as he raced to dinner before the last bell sounded.\nAT MR. NORTON\'S door I stopped with my hand on the knob,\nmumbling a prayer.\n"Come in, young man," he said to my knock. He was dressed in\nfresh linen, the light falling upon his white hair as upon silk floss. A small\npiece of gauze was plastered to his forehead. He was alone.\n"I\'m sorry, sir," I apologized, "but I was told that Dr. Bledsoe wanted\nto see me here . . ."\n"That\'s correct," he said, "but Dr. Bledsoe had to leave. You\'ll find\nhim in his office after chapel."\n"Thank you, sir," I said and turned to go. He cleared his throat\nbehind me. "Young man . . ."\nI turned hopefully.\n"Young man, I have explained to Dr. Bledsoe that you were not at\nfault. I believe he understands."\nI was so relieved that at first I could only look at him, a small\nsilken-haired, white-suited St. Nicholas, seen through misty eyes.\n"I certainly do thank you, sir," I managed finally.\nHe studied me silently, his eyes slightly narrowed.\n"Will you need me this evening, sir?" I asked.\n"No, I won\'t be needing the machine. Business is taking me away\nsooner than I expected. I leave late tonight."\n"I could drive you to the station, sir," I said hopefully.\n"Thank you, but Dr. Bledsoe has already arranged it."\n"Oh," I said with disappointment. I had hoped that by serving him\nthe rest of the week I could win back his esteem. Now I would not have the\nopportunity.\n"Well, I hope you have a pleasant trip, sir," I said.\n"Thank you," he said, suddenly smiling.\n"And maybe next time you come I\'ll be able to answer some of the\nquestions you asked me this afternoon."\n"Questions?" His eyes narrowed.\n"Yes, sir, about . . . about your fate," I said.\n"Ah, yes, yes," he said.\n"And I intend to read Emerson, too . . ."\n"Very good. Self-reliance is a most worthy virtue. I shall look forward\nwith the greatest of interest to learning your contribution to my fate." He\nmotioned me toward the door. "And don\'t forget to see Dr. Bledsoe."\nI left somewhat reassured, but not completely. I still had to face Dr.\nBledsoe. And I had to attend chapel.\nChapter 5\nAt the sound of vespers I moved across the campus with groups of\nstudents, walking slowly, their voices soft in the mellow dusk. I remember the\nyellowed globes of frosted glass making lacy silhouettes on the gravel and the\nwalk of the leaves and branches above us as we moved slow through the\ndusk so restless with scents of lilac, honeysuckle and verbena, and the feel of\nspring greenness; and I recall the sudden arpeggios of laughter lilting across\nthe tender, springtime grass -- gay-welling, far-floating, fluent, spontaneous, a\nbell-like feminine fluting, then suppressed; as though snuffed swiftly and\nirrevocably beneath the quiet solemnity of the vespered air now vibrant with\nsomber chapel bells. Dong! Dong! Dong! Above the decorous walking around\nme, sounds of footsteps leaving the verandas of far-flung buildings and\nmoving toward the walks and over the walks to the asphalt drives lined with\nwhitewashed stones, those cryptic messages for men and women, boys and\ngirls heading quietly toward where the visitors waited, and we moving not in\nthe mood of worship but of judgment; as though even here in the filtering\ndusk, here beneath the deep indigo sky, here, alive with looping swifts and\ndarting moths, here in the hereness of the night not yet lighted by the moon\nthat looms blood-red behind the chapel like a fallen sun, its radiance\nshedding not upon the here-dusk of twittering bats, nor on the there-night of\ncricket and whippoorwill, but focused short-rayed upon our place of\nconvergence; and we drifting forward with rigid motions, limbs stiff and\nvoices now silent, as though on exhibit even in the dark, and the moon a\nwhite man\'s bloodshot eye.\nAnd I move more rigid than all the others with a sense of judgment;\nthe vibrations of the chapel bells stirring the depths of my turmoil, moving\ntoward its nexus with a sense of doom. And I remember the chapel with its\nsweeping eaves, long and low as though risen bloody from the earth like the\nrising moon; vine-covered and earth-colored as though more earth-sprung\nthan man-sprung. And my mind rushing for relief away from the spring dusk\nand flower scents, away from the time-scene of the crucifixion to the\ntime-mood of the birth; from spring-dusk and vespers to the high, clear, lucid\nmoon of winter and snow glinting upon the dwarfed pines where instead of\nthe bells, the organ and the trombone choir speak carols to the distances\ndrifted with snow, making of the night air a sea of crystal water lapping the\nslumbering land to the farthest reaches of sound, for endless miles, bringing\nthe new dispensation even to the Golden Day, even unto the house of\nmadness. But in the hereness of dusk I am moving toward the doomlike bells\nthrough the flowered air, beneath the rising moon.\nInto the doors and into the soft lights I go, silently, past the rows of\npuritanical benches straight and torturous, finding that to which I am\nassigned and bending my body to its agony. There at the head of the\nplatform with its pulpit and rail of polished brass are the banked and\npyramided heads of the student choir, faces composed and stolid above\nuniforms of black and white; and above them, stretching to the ceiling, the\norgan pipes looming, a gothic hierarchy of dull gilded gold.\nAround me the students move with faces frozen in solemn masks,\nand I seem to hear already the voices mechanically raised in the songs the\nvisitors loved. (Loved? Demanded. Sung? An ultimatum accepted and\nritualized, an allegiance recited for the peace it imparted, and for that\nperhaps loved. Loved as the defeated come to love the symbols of their\nconquerors. A gesture of acceptance, of terms laid down and reluctantly\napproved.) And here, sitting rigid, I remember the evenings spent before the\nsweeping platform in awe and in pleasure, and in the pleasure of awe;\nremember the short formal sermons intoned from the pulpit there, rendered\nin smooth articulate tones, with calm assurance purged of that wild emotion\nof the crude preachers most of us knew in our home towns and of whom we\nwere deeply ashamed, these logical appeals which reached us more like the\nthrust of a firm and formal design requiring nothing more than the lucidity\nof uncluttered periods, the lulling movement of multisyllabic words to thrill\nand console us. And I remember, too, the talks of visiting speakers, all eager\nto inform us of how fortunate we were to be a part of the "vast" and formal\nritual. How fortunate to belong to this family sheltered from those lost in\nignorance and darkness.\nHere upon this stage the black rite of Horatio Alger was performed\nto God\'s own acting script, with millionaires come down to portray\nthemselves; not merely acting out the myth of their goodness, and wealth and\nsuccess and power and benevolence and authority in cardboard masks, but\nthemselves, these virtues concretely! Not the wafer and the wine, but the flesh\nand the blood, vibrant and alive, and vibrant even when stooped, ancient and\nwithered. (And who, in face of this, would not believe? Could even doubt?)\nAnd I remember too, how we confronted those others, those who had\nset me here in this Eden, whom we knew though we didn\'t know, who were\nunfamiliar in their familiarity, who trailed their words to us through blood\nand violence and ridicule and condescension with drawling smiles, and who\nexhorted and threatened, intimidated with innocent words as they described to\nus the limitations of our lives and the vast boldness of our aspirations, the\nstaggering folly of our impatience to rise even higher; who, as they talked,\naroused furtive visions within me of blood-froth sparkling their chins like\ntheir familiar tobacco juice, and upon their lips the curdled milk of a million\nblack slave mammies\' withered dugs, a treacherous and fluid knowledge of\nour being, imbibed at our source and now regurgitated foul upon us. This\nwas our world, they said as they described it to us, this our horizon and its\nearth, its seasons and its climate, its spring and its summer, and its fall and\nharvest some unknown millennium ahead; and these its floods and cyclones\nand they themselves our thunder and lightning; and this we must accept and\nlove and accept even if we did not love. We must accept -- even when those\nwere absent, and the men who made the railroads and ships and towers of\nstone, were before our eyes, in the flesh, their voices different, unweighted\nwith recognizable danger and their delight in our songs more sincere seeming,\ntheir regard for our welfare marked by an almost benign and impersonal\nindifference. But the words of the others were stronger than the strength of\nphilanthropic dollars, deeper than shafts sunk in the earth for oil and gold,\nmore awe-inspiring than the miracles fabricated in scientific laboratories. For\ntheir most innocent words were acts of violence to which we of the campus\nwere hypersensitive though we endured them not.\nAnd there on the platform I too had stridden and debated, a student\nleader directing my voice at the highest beams and farthest rafters, ringing\nthem, the accents staccato upon the ridgepole and echoing back with a\ntinkling, like words hurled to the trees of a wilderness, or into a well of\nslate-gray water; more sound than sense, a play upon the resonances of\nbuildings, an assault upon the temples of the ear:\nHa! to the gray-haired matron in the final row. Ha! Miss Susie, Miss\nSusie Gresham, back there looking at that co-ed smiling at that he-ed --\nlisten to me, the bungling bugler of words, imitating the trumpet and the\ntrombone\'s timbre, playing thematic variations like a baritone horn. Hey! old\nconnoisseur of voice sounds, of voices without messages, of newsless winds,\nlisten to the vowel sounds and the crackling dentals, to the low harsh\ngutturals of empty anguish, now riding the curve of a preacher\'s rhythm I\nheard long ago in a Baptist church, stripped now of its imagery: No suns\nhaving hemorrhages, no moons weeping tears, no earthworms refusing the\nsacred flesh and dancing in the earth on Easter morn. Ha! singing\nachievement, Ha! booming success, intoning, Ha! acceptance, Ha! a river of\nword-sounds filled with drowned passions, floating, Ha! with wrecks of\nunachievable ambitions and stillborn revolts, sweeping their ears, Ha! ranged\nstiff before me, necks stretched forward with listening ears, Ha! a-spraying the\nceiling and a-drumming the dark-stained after rafter, that seasoned crossarm\nof torturous timber mellowed in the kiln of a thousand voices; playing Ha! as\nupon a xylophone; words marching like the student band, up the campus and\ndown again, blaring triumphant sounds empty of triumphs. Hey, Miss Susie!\nthe sound of words that were no words, counterfeit notes singing\nachievements yet unachieved, riding upon the wings of my voice out to you,\nold matron, who knew the voice sounds of the Founder and knew the accents\nand echo of his promise; your gray old head cocked with the young around\nyou, your eyes closed, face ecstatic, as I toss the word sounds in my breath,\nmy bellows, my fountain, like bright-colored balls in a water spout -- hear\nme, old matron, justify now this sound with your dear old nod of affirmation,\nyour closed-eye smile and bow of recognition, who\'ll never be fooled with the\nmere content of words, not my words, not these pinfeathered flighters that\nstroke your lids till they flutter with ecstasy with but the mere echoed noise\nof the promise. And after the singing and outward marching, you seize my\nhand and sing out quavering, "Boy, some day you\'ll make the Founder\nproud." Ha! Susie Gresham, Mother Gresham, guardian of the hot young\nwomen on the puritan benches who couldn\'t see your Jordan\'s water for their\nprivate steam; you, relic of slavery whom the campus loved but did not\nunderstand, aged, of slavery, yet bearer of something warm and vital and\nall-enduring, of which in that island of shame we were not ashamed -- it was\nto you on the final row I directed my rush of sound, and it was you of\nwhom I thought with shame and regret as I waited for the ceremony to\nbegin.\nThe honored guests moved silently upon the platform, herded toward\ntheir high, carved chairs by Dr. Bledsoe with the decorum of a portly head\nwaiter. Like some of the guests, he wore striped trousers and a swallow-tail\ncoat with black-braided lapels topped by a rich ascot tie. It was his regular\ndress for such occasions, yet for all its elegance, he managed to make himself\nlook humble. Somehow, his trousers inevitably bagged at the knees and the\ncoat slouched in the shoulders. I watched him smiling at first one and then\nanother of the guests, of whom all but one were white; and as I saw him\nplacing his hand upon their arms, touching their backs, whispering to a tall\nangular-faced trustee who in turn touched his arm familiarly, I felt a shudder.\nI too had touched a white man today and I felt that it had been disastrous,\nand I realized then that he was the only one of us whom I knew -- except\nperhaps a barber or a nursemaid -- who could touch a white man with\nimpunity. And I remembered too that whenever white guests came upon the\nplatform he placed his hand upon them as though exercising a powerful\nmagic. I watched his teeth flash as he took a white hand; then, with all\nseated, he went to his place at the end of the row of chairs.\nSeveral terraces of students\' faces above them, the organist, his eyes\nglinting at the console, was waiting with his head turned over his shoulder,\nand I saw Dr. Bledsoe, his eyes roaming over the audience, suddenly nod\nwithout turning his head. It was as though he had given a downbeat with an\ninvisible baton. The organist turned and hunched his shoulders. A high\ncascade of sound bubbled from the organ, spreading, thick and clinging, over\nthe chapel, slowly surging. The organist twisted and turned on his bench,\nwith his feet flying beneath him as though dancing to rhythms totally\nunrelated to the decorous thunder of his organ.\nAnd Dr. Bledsoe sat with a benign smile of inward concentration. Yet\nhis eyes were darting swiftly, first over the rows of students, then over the\nsection reserved for teachers, his swift glance carrying a threat for all. For he\ndemanded that everyone attend these sessions. It was here that policy was\nannounced in broadest rhetoric. I seemed to feel his eyes resting upon my\nface as he swept the section in which I sat. I looked at the guests on the\nplatform; they sat with that alert relaxation with which they always met our\nupturned eyes. I wondered to which of them I might go to intercede for me\nwith Dr. Bledsoe, but within myself I knew that there was no one.\nIn spite of the array of important men beside him, and despite the\nposture of humility and meekness which made him seem smaller than the\nothers (although he was physically larger), Dr. Bledsoe made his presence felt\nby us with a far greater impact. I remembered the legend of how he had\ncome to the college, a barefoot boy who in his fervor for education had\ntrudged with his bundle of ragged clothing across two states. And how he was\ngiven a job feeding slop to the hogs but had made himself the best slop\ndispenser in the history of the school; and how the Founder had been\nimpressed and made him his office boy. Each of us knew of his rise over\nyears of hard work to the presidency, and each of us at some time wished\nthat he had walked to the school or pushed a wheelbarrow or performed\nsome other act of determination and sacrifice to attest his eagerness for\nknowledge. I remembered the admiration and fear he inspired in everyone on\nthe campus; the pictures in the Negro press captioned "EDUCATOR," in type\nthat exploded like a rifle shot, his face looking out at you with utmost\nconfidence. To us he was more than just a president of a college. He was a\nleader, a "statesman" who carried our problems to those above us, even unto\nthe White House; and in days past he had conducted the President himself\nabout the campus. He was our leader and our magic, who kept the\nendowment high, the funds for scholarships plentiful and publicity moving\nthrough the channels of the press. He was our coal-black daddy of whom we\nwere afraid.\nAs the organ voices died, I saw a thin brown girl arise noiselessly\nwith the rigid control of a modern dancer, high in the upper rows of the\nchoir, and begin to sing a cappella. She began softly, as though singing to\nherself of emotions of utmost privacy, a sound not addressed to the gathering,\nbut which they overheard almost against her will. Gradually she increased its\nvolume, until at times the voice seemed to become a disembodied force that\nsought to enter her, to violate her, shaking her, rocking her rhythmically, as\nthough it had become the source of her being, rather than the fluid web of\nher own creation.\nI saw the guests on the platform turn to look behind them, to see\nthe thin brown girl in white choir robe standing high against the organ pipes,\nherself become before our eyes a pipe of contained, controlled and sublimated\nanguish, a thin plain face transformed by music. I could not understand the\nwords, but only the mood, sorrowful, vague and ethereal, of the singing. It\nthrobbed with nostalgia, regret and repentance, and I sat with a lump in my\nthroat as she sank slowly down; not a sitting but a controlled collapsing, as\nthough she were balancing, sustaining the simmering bubble of her final tone\nby some delicate rhythm of her heart\'s blood, or by some mystic\nconcentration of her being, focused upon the sound through the contained\nliquid of her large uplifted eyes.\nThere was no applause, only the appreciation of a profound silence.\nThe white guests exchanged smiles of approval. I sat thinking of the dread\npossibility of having to leave all this, of being expelled; imagining the return\nhome and the rebukes of my parents. I looked out at the scene now from far\nback in my despair, seeing the platform and its actors as through a reversed\ntelescope; small doll-like figures moving through some meaningless ritual.\nSomeone up there, above the alternating moss-dry and grease-slick heads of\nthe students rowed before me, was making announcements from a lectern on\nwhich a dim light shone. Another figure rose and led a prayer. Someone\nspoke. Then around me everyone was singing Lead me, lead me to a rock\nthat is higher than I. And as though the sound contained some force more\nimperious than the image of the scene of which it was the living connective\ntissue, I was pulled back to its immediacy.\nOne of the guests had risen to speak. A man of striking ugliness; fat,\nwith a bullet-head set on a short neck, with a nose much too wide for its\nface, upon which he wore black-lensed glasses. He had been seated next to\nDr. Bledsoe, but so concerned had I been with the president that I hadn\'t\nreally seen him. My eyes had focused only upon the white men and Dr.\nBledsoe. So that now as he arose and crossed slowly to the center of the\nplatform, I had the notion that part of Dr. Bledsoe had arisen and moved\nforward, leaving his other part smiling in the chair.\nHe stood before us relaxed, his white collar gleaming like a band\nbetween his black face and his dark garments, dividing his head from his\nbody; his short arms crossed before his barrel, like a black little Buddha\'s.\nFor a moment he stood with his large head lifted, as though thinking; then\nhe began speaking, his voice round and vibrant as he told of his pleasure in\nbeing allowed to visit the school once more after many years. Having been\npreaching in a northern city, he had seen it last in the final days of the\nFounder, when Dr. Bledsoe was the "second in command." "Those were\nwonderful days," he droned. "Significant days. Days filled with great portent."\nAs he talked he made a cage of his hands by touching his fingertips,\nthen with his small feet pressing together, he began a slow, rhythmic rocking;\ntilting forward on his toes until it seemed he would fall, then back on his\nheels, the lights catching his black-lensed glasses until it seemed that his head\nfloated free of his body and was held close to it only by the white band of\nhis collar. And as he tilted he talked until a rhythm was established.\nThen he was renewing the dream in our hearts:\n". . . this barren land after Emancipation," he intoned, "this land of\ndarkness and sorrow, of ignorance and degradation, where the hand of\nbrother had been turned against brother, father against son, and son against\nfather; where master had turned against slave and slave against master; where\nall was strife and darkness, an aching land. And into this land came a\nhumble prophet, lowly like the humble carpenter of Nazareth, a slave and a\nson of slaves, knowing only his mother. A slave born, but marked from the\nbeginning by a high intelligence and princely personality; born in the lowest\npart of this barren, war-scarred land, yet somehow shedding light upon it\nwhere\'er he passed through. I\'m sure you have heard of his precarious\ninfancy, his precious life almost destroyed by an insane cousin who splashed\nthe babe with lye and shriveled his seed and how, a mere babe, he lay nine\ndays in a deathlike coma and then suddenly and miraculously recovered. You\nmight say that it was as though he had risen from the dead or been reborn.\n"Oh, my young friends," he cried, beaming, "my young friends, it is\nindeed a beautiful story. I\'m sure you\'ve heard it many times: Recall how he\ncame upon his initial learning through shrewd questioning of his little\nmasters, the elder masters never suspecting; and how he learned his alphabet\nand taught himself to read and solve the secret of words, going instinctively\nto the Holy Bible with its great wisdom for his first knowledge. And you\nknow how he escaped and made his way across mountain and valley to that\nplace of learning and how he persisted and worked noontimes, nights and\nmornings for the privilege of studying, or, as the old folk would say, of\n\'rubbing his head against the college wall.\' You know of his brilliant career,\nhow already he was a moving orator; then his penniless graduation and his\nreturn after years to this country.\n"And then his great struggle beginning. Picture it, my young friends:\nThe clouds of darkness all over the land, black folk and white folk full of\nfear and hate, wanting to go forward, but each fearful of the other. A whole\nregion is caught in a terrible tension. Everyone is perplexed with the question\nof what must be done to dissolve this fear and hatred that crouched over the\nland like a demon waiting to spring, and you know how he came and showed\nthem the way. Oh, yes, my friends. I\'m sure you\'ve heard it time and time\nagain; of this godly man\'s labors, his great humility and his undimming\nvision, the fruits of which you enjoy today; concrete, made flesh; his dream,\nconceived in the starkness and darkness of slavery, fulfilled now even in the\nair you breathe, in the sweet harmonies of your blended voices, in the\nknowledge which each of you -- daughters and granddaughters, sons and\ngrandsons, of slaves -- all of you partaking of it in bright and well-equipped\nclassrooms. You must see this slave, this black Aristotle, moving slowly, with\nsweet patience, with a patience not of mere man, but of God-inspired faith --\nsee him moving slowly as he surmounts each and every opposition. Rendering\nunto Caesar that which was Caesar\'s, yes; but steadfastly seeking for you that\nbright horizon which you now enjoy . . .\n"All this," he said, spreading his fingers palm down before him, "has\nbeen told and retold throughout the land, inspiring a humble but fast-rising\npeople. You have heard it, and it -- this true story of rich implication, this\nliving parable of proven glory and humble nobility -- and it, as I say, has\nmade you free. Even you who have come to this shrine only this semester\nknow it. You have heard his name from your parents, for it was he who led\nthem to the path, guiding them like a great captain; like that great pilot of\nancient times who led his people safe and unharmed across the bottom of the\nblood-red sea. And your parents followed this remarkable man across the\nblack sea of prejudice, safely out of the land of ignorance, through the storms\nof fear and anger, shouting, LET MY PEOPLE GO! when it was necessary,\nwhispering it during those times when whispering was wisest. And he was\nheard."\nI listened, my back pressing against the hard bench, with a\nnumbness, my emotions woven into his words as upon a loom.\n"And remember how," he said, "when he entered a certain state at\ncotton-picking time, his enemies had plotted to take his life. And recall how\nduring his journey he was stopped by the strange figure of a man whose\npitted features revealed no inkling of whether he was black or white . . .\nSome say he was a Greek. Some a Mongolian. Others a mulatto -- and others\nstill, a simple white man of God. Whoever, and whatsoever, and we must not\nrule out the possibility of an emissary direct from above -- oh, yes! -- and\nremember how he appeared suddenly, startling both Founder and horse as he\ngave warning, telling the Founder to leave the horse and buggy there in the\nroad and proceed immediately to a certain cabin, then slipped silently away,\nso silently, my young friends, that the Founder doubted his very existence.\nAnd you know how the great man continued through the dusk, determined\nthough puzzled as he approached the town. He was lost, lost in reverie until\nthe crack of the first rifle sounded, then the almost fatal volley that creased\nhis skull -- oh my! -- and left him stunned and apparently lifeless.\n"I have heard him tell with his own lips how consciousness returned\nwhile they were still upon him examining their foul deed, and how he lay\nbiting his heart lest they hear it and wipe out their failure with a\ncoup-de-grace, as the French would say. Ha! And I\'m sure you\'ve each of you\nlived with him through his escape," he said, seeming to look directly into my\nwatered eyes. "You awakened when he awakened, rejoiced when he rejoiced at\ntheir leaving without further harm; arising when he arose; seeing with his\neyes the prints of their milling footsteps and the cartridges dropped in the\ndust about the imprint of his fallen body; yes, and the cold, dust-encrusted,\nbut not quite fatal blood. And you hurried with him full of doubt to the\ncabin designated by the stranger, where he met that seemingly demented\nblack man . . . You remember that old one, laughed at by the children in the\ntown\'s square, old, comic-faced, crafty, cotton-headed. And yet it was he who\nbound up your wounds with the wounds of the Founder. He, the old slave,\nshowing a surprising knowledge of such matters -- germology and scabology --\nha! ha! -- he called it, and what a youthful skill of the hands! For he shaved\nour skull, and cleansed our wound and bound it neat with bandages stolen\nfrom the home of an unsuspecting leader of the mob, ha! And you recall how\nyou plunged with the Founder, the Leader, deep into the black art of escape,\nguided at first, indeed, initiated, by the seemingly demented one who had\nlearned his craft in slavery. You left with the Founder in the black of night,\nand I know it. You hurried silently along the river bottom, stung by\nmosquitoes, hooted by owls, zoomed by bats, buzzed by snakes that rattled\namong the rocks, mud and fever, darkness and sighing. You hid all the\nfollowing day in the cabin where thirteen slept in three small rooms, standing\nuntil darkness in the fireplace chimney, back in all the soot and ashes -- ha!\nha! -- guarded by the granny who dozed at the hearth seemingly without a\nfire. You stood in the blackness and when they came with their baying\nhounds they thought her demented. But she knew, she knew! She knew the\nfire! She knew the fire! She knew the fire that burned without consuming!\nMy God, yes!"\n"My God, yes!" a woman\'s voice responded, adding to the structure\nof his vision within me.\n"And you left with him in the morning, hidden in a wagonload of\ncotton, in the very center of the fleece, where you breathed the hot air\nthrough the barrel of the emergency shotgun; the cartridges, which thank God\nit was unnecessary to use, held fanwise and ready between the spread fingers\nof your hand. And you went into this town with him and were hidden by the\nfriendly aristocrat one night, and on the next by the white blacksmith who\nheld no hatred -- surprising contradictions of the underground. Escaping, yes!\nhelped by those who knew you and those who didn\'t know. Because for some\nit was enough to see him; others helped without even that, black and white.\nBut mostly it was our own who aided, because you were their own and we\nhave always helped our own. And so, my young friends, my sisters and\nbrothers, you went with him, in and out of cabins, by night and early\nmorning, through swamps and hills. On and on, passed from black hand to\nblack hand and some white hands, and all the hands molding the Founder\'s\nfreedom and our own freedom like voices shaping a deep-felt song. And you,\neach of you, were with him. Ah, how well you know it, for it was you who\nescaped to freedom. Ah, yes, and you know the story."\nI saw him resting now, and beaming out across the chapel, his huge\nhead turning to all its corners like a beacon, his voice still echoing as I\nfought back my emotion. For the first time the evocation of the Founder\nsaddened me, and the campus seemed to rush past me, fast retreating, like\nthe fading of a dream at the sundering of slumber. Beside me, the student\'s\neyes swam with a distorting cataract of tears, his features rigid as though he\nstruggled within himself. The fat man was playing upon the whole audience\nwithout the least show of exertion. He seemed completely composed, hidden\nbehind his black-lensed glasses, only his mobile features gesturing his vocal\ndrama. I nudged the boy beside me.\n"Who is he?" I whispered.\nHe gave me a look of annoyance, almost of outrage. "Reverend\nHomer A. Barbee, Chicago," he said.\nNow the speaker rested his arm upon the lectern and turned toward\nDr. Bledsoe:\n"You\'ve heard the bright beginning of the beautiful story, my friends.\nBut there is the mournful ending, and perhaps in many ways the richer side.\nThe setting of this glorious son of the morning."\nHe turned to Dr. Bledsoe, "It was a fateful day, Dr. Bledsoe, sir, if I\nmay recall it to you, for we were there. Oh yes, my young friends," he said,\nturning to face us again with a sad proud smile. "I knew him well and loved\nhim, and I was there.\n"We had toured through several states to which he was carrying the\nmessage. The people had come to hear the prophet, the multitude had\nresponded. The old-fashioned people; women in aprons and Mother Hubbards\nof calico and gingham, men in their overalls and patched alpacas; a sea of\nupturned and puzzled faces looking out from beneath old battered straw hats\nand limp sunbonnets. They who had come by oxen and mule team and by\nwalking long distances. It was the month of September and unseasonably\ncold. He had spoken peace and confidence into their troubled souls, had set a\nstar before them and we were passing on to other scenes, still carrying the\nmessage.\n"Ah, those days of ceaseless travel, those youthful days, those\nspringtime days; fertile, blossomy, sun-filled days of promise. Ah, yes, those\nindescribably glorious days, in which the Founder was building the dream not\nonly here in this then barren valley, but hither and yonder throughout the\nland, instilling the dream in the hearts of the people. Erecting the scaffolding\nof a nation. Broadcasting his message that fell like seed on tallow ground,\nsacrificing himself, fighting and forgiving his enemies of both complexions-oh\nyes, he had them, of both complexions. But going forward filled with the\nimportance of his message, filled with his dedicated mission; and in his zeal,\nperhaps in his mortal pride, ignoring the advice of his physician. I see in my\nmind\'s eye the fatal atmosphere of that jam-packed auditorium: The Founder\nholds the audience within the gentle palm of his eloquence, rocking it,\nsoothing it, instructing it; and there below, the rapt faces blushed by the glow\nof the big pot-bellied stove now turned cherry-red with its glowing; yes, the\nspellbound rows caught in the imperious truth of his message. And I hear\nnow, again, the great humming hush as his voice reached the end of a\nmighty period, and one of the listeners, a snowy-headed man, leaps to his\nfeet crying out, \'Tell us what is to be done, sir! For God\'s sake, tell us! Tell\nus in the name of the son they snatched from me last week!\' And all through\nthe room the voices arising, imploring, \'Tell us, tell us!\' And the Founder is\nsuddenly mute with tears."\nOld Barbee\'s voice rang out, as suddenly he made charged and\nincomplete movements about the platform, acting out his words. And I\nwatched with a sick fascination, knowing part of the story, yet a part of me\nfighting against its sad inevitable conclusion.\n"And the Founder pauses, then steps forward with his eyes spilling\nhis great emotion. With his arm upraised, he begins to answer and totters.\nThen all is commotion. We rush forward and lead him away.\n"The audience leaps to its feet in consternation. All is terror and\nturmoil, a moan and a sighing. Until, like a clap of thunder, I hear Dr.\nBledsoe\'s voice ring out whip-like with authority, a song of hope. And as we\nstretch the Founder upon a bench to rest, I hear Dr. Bledsoe stomping out\nthe time with mighty strokes upon the hollow platform, commanding not in\nwords but in the great gut-tones of his magnificent basso -- oh, but wasn\'t he\na singer? Isn\'t he a singer still today? -- and they stand, they calm, and with\nhim they sing out against the tottering of their giant. Sing out their long\nblack songs of blood and bones:\n"Meaning HOPE!\n"Of hardship and pain:\n"Meaning FAITH!\n"Of humbleness and absurdity:\n"Meaning ENDURANCE!\n"Of ceaseless struggle in darkness, meaning:\n"TRIUMPH . . .\n"Ha!" Barbee cried, slapping his hands, "Ha! Singing verse after\nverse, until the leader revived!" (Slap, slap of his hands.)\n"Addressed them" --\n(Slap!) "My God, my God!\n"Assured them" -- (Slap!)\n"That" -- (Slap!)\n"He was only tired of his ceaseless efforts." (Slap!) "Yes, and\ndismisses them, sending each on his way rejoicing, giving each a parting\nhandshake of fellowship . . ."\nI watched Barbee pace in a semicircle, his lips compressed, his face\nworking with emotion, his palms meeting but making no sound.\n"Ah, those days in which he tilled his mighty fields, those days in\nwhich he watched the crops take hold and grow, those youthful, summery,\nsun-bright days . . ."\nBarbee\'s voice sighed off in nostalgia. The chapel hardly breathed as\nhe sighed deeply. Then I watched him produce a snowy handkerchief, remove\nhis dark glasses and wipe his eyes, and through the increasing distance of my\nisolation, I watched the men in the seats of honor slowly shake their\nspellbound heads. Then Barbee\'s voice began again, disembodied now, and it\nwas as though he had never paused, as though his words, reverberating\nwithin us, had continued their rhythmic flow though their source was for a\nmoment stilled:\n"Oh, yes, my young friends, oh, yes," he continued with a great\nsadness. "Man\'s hope can paint a purple picture, can transform a soaring\nvulture into a noble eagle or a moaning dove. Oh, yes! But I knew," he\nshouted, startling me. "In spite of that great, anguished hope within me, I\nknew -- knew that the great spirit was declining, was approaching its lonely\nwinter; the great sun going down. For sometimes it is given one to know\nthese things . . . And I staggered under the awful burden of that knowledge\nand I cursed myself because I bore it. But such was the Founder\'s enthusiasm\n-- oh, yes! -- that as we sped from country town to country town through the\nglorious Indian summer, I soon forgot. And then . . . And then . . . and . . .\nthen . . ."\nI listened to his voice fall to a whisper; his hands were outspread as\nthough he were leading an orchestra into a profound and final diminuendo.\nThen his voice rose again, crisply, almost matter-of-factly, accelerated:\n"I remember the start of the train, how it seemed to groan as it\nstarted up the steep grade into the mountain. It was cold. Frost formed its\nicy patterns upon the window\'s edges. And the whistle of the train was\nlong-drawn and lonely, a sigh issuing from the depths of the mountain.\n"In the car up ahead, in the Pullman assigned him by the very\npresident of the line, the Leader lay tossing. He had been struck with a\nsudden and mysterious sickness. And I knew in spite of the anguish within\nme that the sun goeth down, for the heavens themselves conveyed that\nknowledge. The rush of the train, the clicking of wheels upon the steel. I\nremember how I looked out of the frosted pane and saw the looming great\nNorth Star and lost it, as though the sky had shut its eye. The train was\ncurving the mountain, the engine loping like a great black hound, parallel\nwith the last careening cars, panting forth its pale white vapor as it hurled us\never higher. And shortly the sky was black, without a moon . . ."\nAs his "mooo-o-on" echoed over the chapel, he drew his chin against\nhis chest until his white collar disappeared, leaving him a figure of balanced\nunbroken blackness, and I could hear the rasp of air as he inhaled.\n"It was as though the very constellations knew our impending\nsorrow," he bugled, his head raised to the ceiling, his voice full-throated. "For\nagainst that great -- wide -- sweep of sable there came the burst of a single\njewel-like star, and I saw it shimmer, and break, and streak down the cheek\nof that coal-black sky like a reluctant and solitary tear . . ."\nHe shook his head with great emotion, his lips pursed as he moaned,\n"Mmmmmmmmmm," turning toward Dr. Bledsoe as though he did not quite\nsee him. "At that fateful moment . . . Mmmmmm, I sat with your great\npresident . . . Mmmmmmmmmm! He was deep in meditation as we awaited\nword from the men of science, and he said to me of that dying star,\n" \'Barbee, friend, did you see?\'\n"And I answered, \'Yes, Doctor, I saw.\'\n"And at our throats already we felt the cold hands of sorrow. And I\nsaid to Dr. Bledsoe, \'Let us pray.\' And as we knelt there on the swaying floor\nour words were less prayers than sounds of mute and terrible sorrow. And it\nwas then, as we pulled to our feet, staggering with the motion of that\nspeeding train, that we saw the physician moving toward us. And we looked\nwith bated breath into the blank and expressionless features of the man of\nscience, asking with our total beings: Do you bring us hope or disaster? And\nit was then and there he informed us that the Leader was nearing his\ndestination . . .\n"It was said, the cruel blow had fallen and we were left numb, but\nthe Founder was still for the moment with us and still in command. And, of\nall in the traveling party, he sent for him who sits there before you, and for\nme as a man of God. But he wanted mainly his friend of midnight\nconsultations, his comrade of many battles, who over the weary years had\nremained steadfast in defeat as in victory.\n"Even now I can see it, the dark passage lit with dim lights and Dr.\nBledsoe swaying as he went before me. At the door stood the porter and the\nconductor, a black man and a white man of the South, both crying. Both\nweeping. And he looked up as we entered, his great eyes resigned but still\naflame with nobility and courage against the white of his pillow; and he\nlooked at his friend and smiled. Smiled warmly at his old campaigner, his\nloyal champion, his adjunct, that marvelous singer of the old songs who had\nrallied his spirit during times of distress and discouragement, who with his\nsinging of the old familiar melodies soothed the doubts and fears of the\nmultitude; he who had rallied the ignorant, the fearful and suspicious, those\nstill wrapped in the rags of slavery; him, there, your leader, who calmed the\nchildren of the storm. And as the Founder looked up at his companion, he\nsmiled. And reaching out his hand to his friend and companion as I now\nstretch out my hand to you, he said, \'Come closer. Come closer.\' And he\nmoved closer, until he stood beside the berth, and the light slanting across\nhis shoulder as he knelt beside him. And the hand reached out and gently\ntouched him and he said, \'Now, you must take on the burden. Lead them the\nrest of the way.\' And oh, the cry of that train and the pain too big for tears!\n"When the train reached the summit of the mountain, he was no\nlonger with us. And as the train dropped down the grade he had departed.\n"It had become a veritable train of sorrow. Dr. Bledsoe there, sat\nweary in mind and heavy of heart. What should he do? The Leader was dead\nand he thrown suddenly at the head of the troops like a cavalryman\ncatapulted into the saddle of his general felled in a charge of battle-vaulted\nonto the back of his fiery and half-broken charger. Ah! And that great, black,\nnoble beast, wall-eyed with the din of battle and twitching already with its\nsense of loss. What command should he give? Should he return with his\nburden, home, to where already the hot wires were flashing, speaking, rattling\nthe mournful message? Should he turn and bear the fallen soldier down the\ncold and alien mountain to this valley home? Return with the dear eyes\ndulled, the firm hand still, the magnificent voice silent, the Leader cold?\nReturn to the warm valley, to the green grounds he could no longer light\nwith his mortal vision? Should he follow his Leader\'s vision though he had\nnow himself departed?\n"Ah, of course you know the story: How he bore the body into the\nstrange city, and the speech he made as his Leader lay in state, and how\nwhen the sad news spread, a day of mourning was declared for the whole\nmunicipality. Oh, and how rich and poor, black and white, weak and\npowerful, young and old, all came to pay their homage-many realizing the\nLeader\'s worth and their loss only now with his passing. And how, with his\nmission done, Dr. Bledsoe returned, keeping his sorrowful vigil with his friend\nin an humble baggage car; and how the people came to pay their respects at\nthe stations . . . A slow train. A sorrowful train. And all along the line, in\nmountain and valley, wherever the rails found their fateful course, the people\nwere one in their common mourning, and like the cold steel rails, were\nspiked down to their sorrow. Oh, what a sad departure!\n"And what an even sadder arrival. See with me, my young friends,\nhear with me: The weeping and wailing of those who shared his labors. Their\nsweet Leader returned to them, rock-cold in the iron immobility of death. He\nwho had left them quick, in the prime of his manhood, author of their own\nfire and illumination, returned to them cold, already a bronzed statue. Oh,\nthe despair, my young friends. The black despair of black people! I see them\nnow; wandering about these grounds, where each brick, each bird, each blade\nof grass was a reminder of some precious memory; and each memory a\nhammer stroke driving home the blunt spikes of their sorrow. Oh, yes, some\nnow are here gray-haired among you, still dedicated to his vision, still\nlaboring in the vineyard. But then with the black-draped coffin lying in state\namong them -- inescapably reminding them -- they felt the dark night of\nslavery settling once more upon them. They smelt that old obscene stink of\ndarkness, that old slavery smell, worse than the rank halitosis of hoary death.\nTheir sweet light enclosed in a black-draped coffin, their majestic sun\nsnatched behind a cloud.\n"Oh, and the sad sound of weeping bugles! I can hear them now,\nstationed at the four corners of the campus, sounding taps for the fallen\ngeneral; announcing and re-announcing the sad tidings, telling and retelling\nthe sad revelation one to the other across the still numbness of the air, as\nthough they could not believe it, could neither comprehend nor accept it;\nbugles weeping like a family of tender women lamenting their loved one. And\nthe people came to sing the old songs and to express their unspeakable\nsorrow. Black, black, black! Black people in blacker mourning, the funeral\ncrape hung upon their naked hearts; singing unashamedly their black folk\'s\nsongs of sorrow, moving painfully, overflowing the curving walks, weeping and\nwailing beneath the drooping trees and their low murmuring voices like the\nmoans of winds in a wilderness. And finally they gathered on the hill slope\nand as far as the tear-wet eyes could see, they stood with their heads bowed,\nsinging.\n"Then silence. The lonesome hole banked with poignant flowers. The\ndozen white-gloved hands waiting taut upon the silken ropes. That awful\nsilence. The final words are spoken. A single wild rose tossed farewell, bursts\nslowly, its petals drifting snowlike upon the reluctantly lowered coffin. Then\ndown into the earth; back to the ancient dust; back to the cold black clay . .\n. mother . . . of us all."\nAs Barbee paused the silence was so complete that I could hear the\npower engines far across the campus throbbing the night like an excited\npulse. Somewhere in the audience an old woman\'s voice began a plaintive\nwail; the birth of a sad, untormulated song that died stillborn in a sob.\nBarbee stood with his head thrown back, his arms rigid at his sides,\nhis fists clenched as though fighting desperately for control. Dr. Bledsoe sat\nwith his face in his hands. Near me someone blew his nose. Barbee took a\ntottering step forward.\n"Oh, yes. Oh, yes," he said. "Oh, yes. That too is part of the glorious\nstory. But think of it not as a death, but as a birth. A great seed had been\nplanted. A seed which has continued to put forth its fruit in its season as\nsurely as if the great creator had been resurrected. For in a sense he was, if\nnot in the flesh, in the spirit. And in a sense in the flesh too. For has not\nyour present leader become his living agent, his physical presence? Look\nabout you if you doubt it. My young friends, my dear young friends! How\ncan I tell you what manner of man this is who leads you? How can I convey\nto you how well he has kept his pledge to the Founder, how conscientious\nhas been his stewardship?\n"First, you must see the school as it was. Already a great institution,\nto be sure; but then the buildings were eight, now they are twenty; then the\nfaculty was fifty, now it is two hundred; then the student body was a few\nhundred, where now I\'m told you are three thousand. And now where you\nhave roads of asphalt for the passage of rubber tires, then the roads were of\ncrushed stone for the passage of oxen, and mule teams, and horse-drawn\nwagons. I have not the words to tell you how my heart swelled to return to\nthis great institution after so great a while to move among its wealth of green\nthings, its fruitful farmland and fragrant campus. Ah! and the marvelous plant\nsupplying power to an area larger than many towns -- all operated by black\nhands. Thus, my young friends, does the light of the Founder still burn. Your\nleader has kept his promise a thousandfold. I commend him in his own right,\nfor he is the co-architect of a great and noble experiment. He is a worthy\nsuccessor to his great friend and it is no accident that his great and\nintelligent leadership has made him our leading statesman. This is a form of\ngreatness worthy of your imitation. I say to you, pattern yourselves upon him.\nAspire, each of you, to some day follow in his footsteps. Great deeds are yet\nto be performed. For we are a young, though a fast-rising, people. Legends\nare still to be created. Be not afraid to undertake the burdens of your leader,\nand the work of the Founder will be one of ever unfolding glory, the history\nof the race a saga of mounting triumphs."\nBarbee stood with his arms outstretched now, beaming over the\naudience, his Buddha-like body still as an onyx boulder. There was sniffling\nthroughout the chapel. Voices murmured with admiration and I felt more lost\nthan ever. For a few minutes old Barbee had made me see the vision and\nnow I knew that leaving the campus would be like the parting of flesh. I\nwatched him lower his arms now and start back to his chair, moving slowly\nwith his head cocked as though listening to distant music. I had lowered my\nhead to wipe my eyes when I heard the shocked gasp arise.\nLooking up, I saw two of the white trustees moving swiftly across the\nplatform to where Barbee floundered upon Dr. Bledsoe\'s legs. The old man\nslid forward upon his hands and knees as the two white men took his arms;\nand now as he stood I saw one of them reach for something on the floor\nand place it in his hands. It was when he raised his head that I saw it. For\na swift instant, between the gesture and the opaque glitter of his glasses, I\nsaw the blinking of sightless eyes. Homer A. Barbee was blind.\nUttering apologies, Dr. Bledsoe helped him to his chair. Then as the\nold man rested back with a smile, Dr. Bledsoe walked to the edge of the\nplatform and lifted his arms. I closed my eyes as I heard the deep moaning\nsound that issued from him, and the rising crescendo of the student body\njoining in. This time it was music sincerely felt, not rendered for the guests,\nbut for themselves; a song of hope and exaltation. I wanted to rush from the\nbuilding, but didn\'t dare. I sat stiff and erect, supported by the hard bench,\nrelying upon it as upon a form of hope.\nI could not look at Dr. Bledsoe now, because old Barbee had made\nme both feel my guilt and accept it. For although I had not intended it, any\nact that endangered the continuity of the dream was an act of treason.\nI did not listen to the next speaker, a tall white man who kept\ndabbing at his eyes with a handkerchief and repeating his phrases in an\nemotional and inarticulate manner. Then the orchestra played excerpts from\nDvorak\'s New World Symphony and I kept hearing "Swing Low Sweet\nChariot" resounding through its dominant theme -- my mother\'s and\ngrandfather\'s favorite spiritual. It was more than I could stand, and before the\nnext speaker could begin I hurried past the disapproving eyes of teachers and\nmatrons, out into the night.\nA mockingbird trilled a note from where it perched upon the hand of\nthe moonlit Founder, flipping its moon-mad tail above the head of the\neternally kneeling slave. I went up the shadowy drive, heard it trill behind\nme. The street lamps glowed brilliant in the moonlit dream of the campus,\neach light serene in its cage of shadows.\nI might well have waited until the end of the services, for I hadn\'t\ngone far when I heard the dim, bright notes of the orchestra striking up a\nmarch, followed by a burst of voices as the students filed out into the night.\nWith a feeling of dread I headed for the administration building, and upon\nreaching it, stood in the darkened doorway. My mind fluttered like the moths\nthat veiled the street lamp which cast shadows upon the bank of grass below\nme. I would now have my real interview with Dr. Bledsoe, and I recalled\nBarbee\'s address with resentment. With such words fresh in his mind, I was\nsure Dr. Bledsoe would be far less sympathetic to my plea. I stood in that\ndarkened doorway trying to probe my future if I were expelled. Where would\nI go, what would I do? How could I ever return home?\nChapter 6\nDown the sloping lawn below me the male students moved toward\ntheir dormitories, seeming far away from me now, remote, and each shadowy\nform vastly superior to me, who had by some shortcoming cast myself into\nthe darkness away from all that was worthwhile and inspiring. I listened to\none group harmonize quietly as they passed. The smell of fresh bread being\nprepared in the bakery drifted to me. The good white bread of breakfast; the\nrolls dripping with yellow butter that I had slipped into my pocket so often\nto be munched later in my room with wild blackberry jam from home.\nLights began to appear in the girls\' dormitories, like the bursting of\nluminous seeds flung broadside by an invisible hand. Several cars rolled by. I\nsaw a group of old women who lived in the town approaching. One used a\ncane which from time to time she tapped hollowly upon the walk like a blind\nman. Snatches of their conversation fluttered to me as they discussed Barbee\'s\ntalk with enthusiasm, recalled the times of the Founder, their quavering voices\nweaving and embroidering his story. Then down the long avenue of trees I\nsaw the familiar Cadillac approaching and started inside the building,\nsuddenly filled with panic. I hadn\'t gone two steps before I turned and\nhurried out into the night again. I couldn\'t stand to face Dr. Bledsoe\nimmediately. I was fairly shivering as I fell in behind a group of boys going\nup the drive. They were arguing some point heatedly, but I was too agitated\nto listen and simply followed in their shadows, noticing the dull gleam of\ntheir polished shoe-leather in the rays of the street lamps. I kept trying to\nformulate what I would say to Dr. Bledsoe, and the boys must have turned\ninto their building, for suddenly finding myself outside the gates of the\ncampus and heading down the highway, I turned and ran back to the\nbuilding.\nWhen I went in he was wiping his neck with a blue-bordered\nhandkerchief. The shaded lamp catching the lenses of his glasses left half of\nhis broad face in shadow as his clenched fists stretched full forth in the light\nbefore him. I stood, hesitating in the door, aware suddenly of the old heavy\nfurnishings, the relics from the times of the Founder, the framed portrait\nphotographs and relief plaques of presidents and industrialists, men of\npower-fixed like trophies or heraldic emblems upon the walls.\n"Come in," he said from the half-shadow; then I saw him move and\nhis head coming forward, his eyes burning.\nHe began mildly, as if quietly joking, throwing me off balance.\n"Boy," he said, "I understand that you not only carried Mr. Norton\nout to the Quarters but that you wound up at that sinkhole, that Golden\nDay."\nIt was a statement, not a question. I said nothing and he looked at\nme with the same mild gaze. Had Barbee helped Mr. Norton soften him?\n"No," he said, "it wasn\'t enough to take him to the Quarters, you\nhad to make the complete tour, to give him the full treatment. Was that it?"\n"No, sir . . . I mean that he was ill, sir," I said. "He had to have\nsome whiskey . . ."\n"And that was the only place you knew to go," he said. "So you went\nthere because you were taking care of him . . ."\n"Yes, sir . . ."\n"And not only that," he said in a voice that both mocked and\nmarveled, "you took him out and sat him down on the gallery, veranda --\npiazza -- whatever they call it now\'days -- and introduced him to the quality!"\n"Quality?" I frowned. "Oh -- but he insisted that I stop, sir. There\nwas nothing I could do . . ."\n"Of course," he said. "Of course."\n"He was interested in the cabins, sir. He was surprised that there\nwere any left."\n"So naturally you stopped," he said, bowing his head again.\n"Yes, sir."\n"Yes, and I suppose the cabin opened up and told him its life history\nand all the choice gossip?"\nI started to explain.\n"Boy!" he exploded. "Are you serious? Why were you out on that\nroad in the first place? Weren\'t you behind the wheel?"\n"Yes, sir . . ."\n"Then haven\'t we bowed and scraped and begged and lied enough\ndecent homes and drives for you to show him? Did you think that white man\nhad to come a thousand miles -- all the way from New York and Boston and\nPhiladelphia just for you to show him a slum? Don\'t just stand there, say\nsomething!"\n"But I was only driving him, sir. I only stopped there after he\nordered me to . . ."\n"Ordered you?" he said. "He ordered you. Dammit, white folk are\nalways giving orders, it\'s a habit with them. Why didn\'t you make an excuse?\nCouldn\'t you say they had sickness -- smallpox -- or picked another cabin?\nWhy that Trueblood shack? My God, boy! You\'re black and living in the\nSouth -- did you forget how to lie?"\n"Lie, sir? Lie to him, lie to a trustee, sir? Me?"\nHe shook his head with a kind of anguish. "And me thinking I\'d\npicked a boy with brain," he said. "Didn\'t you know you were endangering\nthe school?"\n"But I was only trying to please him . . ."\n"Please him? And here you are a junior in college! Why, the dumbest\nblack bastard in the cotton patch knows that the only way to please a white\nman is to tell him a lie! What kind of education are you getting around\nhere? Who really told you to take him out there?" he said.\n"He did, sir. No one else."\n"Don\'t lie to me!"\n"That\'s the truth, sir."\n"I warn you now, who suggested it?"\n"I swear, sir. No one told me."\n"Nigger, this isn\'t the time to lie. I\'m no white man. Tell me the\ntruth!"\nIt was as though he\'d struck me. I stared across the desk thinking,\nHe called me that . . .\n"Answer me, boy!"\nThat, I thought, noticing the throbbing of a vein that rose between\nhis eyes, thinking, He called me that.\n"I wouldn\'t lie, sir," I said.\n"Then who was that patient you were talking with?"\n"I never saw him before, sir."\n"What was he saying?"\n"I can\'t recall it all," I muttered. "The man was raving."\n"Speak up. What did he say?"\n"He thinks that he lived in France and that he\'s a great doctor . . ."\n"Continue."\n"He said that I believed that white was right," I said.\n"What?" Suddenly his face twitched and cracked like the surface of\ndark water. "And you do, don\'t you?" Dr. Bledsoe said, suppressing a nasty\nlaugh. "Well, don\'t you?"\nI did not answer, thinking, You, you . . .\n"Who was he, did you ever see him before?"\n"No, sir, I hadn\'t."\n"Was he northern or southern?"\n"I don\'t know, sir."\nHe struck his desk. "College for Negroes! Boy, what do you know\nother than how to ruin an institution in half an hour that it took over half a\nhundred years to build? Did he talk northern or southern?"\n"He talked like a white man," I said, "except that his voice sounded\nsouthern, like one of ours . . ."\n"I\'ll have to investigate him," he said. "A Negro like that should be\nunder lock and key."\nAcross the campus a clock struck the quarter hour and something\ninside me seemed to muffle its sound. I turned to him desperately. "Dr.\nBledsoe, I\'m awfully sorry. I had no intention of going there but things just\ngot out of hand. Mr. Norton understands how it happened . . ."\n"Listen to me, boy," he said loudly. "Norton is one man and I\'m\nanother, and while he might think he\'s satisfied, I know that he isn\'t! Your\npoor judgment has caused this school incalculable damage. Instead of uplifting\nthe race, you\'ve torn it down."\nHe looked at me as though I had committed the worst crime\nimaginable. "Don\'t you know we can\'t tolerate such a thing? I gave you an\nopportunity to serve one of our best white friends, a man who could make\nyour fortune. But in return you dragged the entire race into the slime!"\nSuddenly he reached for something beneath a pile of papers, an old leg\nshackle from slavery which he proudly called a "symbol of our progress."\n"You\'ve got to be disciplined, boy," he said. "There\'s no ifs and ands\nabout it."\n"But you gave Mr. Norton your word . . ."\n"Don\'t stand there and tell me what I already know. Regardless of\nwhat I said, as the leader of this institution I can\'t possibly let this pass. Boy,\nI\'m getting rid of you!" It must have happened when the metal struck the\ndesk, for suddenly I was leaning toward him, shouting with outrage.\n"I\'ll tell him," I said. "I\'ll go to Mr. Norton and tell him. You\'ve lied\nto both of us . . ."\n"What!" he said. "You have the nerve to threaten me . . . in my own\noffice?"\n"I\'ll tell him," I screamed. "I\'ll tell everybody. I\'ll fight you. I swear\nit, I\'ll fight!"\n"Well," he said, sitting back, "well, I\'ll be damned!" For a moment he\nlooked me up and down and I saw his head go back into the shadow,\nhearing a high, thin sound like a cry of rage; then his face came forward and\nI saw his laughter. For an instant I stared; then I wheeled and started for\nthe door, hearing him sputter, "Wait, wait," behind me.\nI turned. He gasped for breath, propping his huge head up with his\nhands as tears streamed down his face.\n"Come on, come," he said, removing his glasses and wiping his eyes.\n"Come on, son," his voice amused and conciliatory. It was as though I were\nbeing put through a fraternity initiation and found myself going back. He\nlooked at me, still laughing with agony. My eyes burned.\n"Boy, you are a fool," he said. "Your white folk didn\'t teach you\nanything and your mother-wit has left you cold. What has happened to you\nyoung Negroes? I thought you had caught on to how things are done down\nhere. But you don\'t even know the difference between the way things are and\nthe way they\'re supposed to be. My God," he gasped, "what is the race\ncoming to? Why, boy, you can tell anyone you like -- sit down there . . . Sit\ndown, sir, I say!"\nReluctantly I sat, torn between anger and fascination, hating myself\nfor obeying.\n"Tell anyone you like," he said. "I don\'t care. I wouldn\'t raise my\nlittle finger to stop you. Because I don\'t owe anyone a thing, son. Who,\nNegroes? Negroes don\'t control this school or much of anything else --\nhaven\'t you learned even that? No, sir, they don\'t control this school, nor\nwhite folk either. True they support it, but I control it. I\'s big and black and\nI say \'Yes, suh\' as loudly as any burr-head when it\'s convenient, but I\'m still\nthe king down here. I don\'t care how much it appears otherwise. Power\ndoesn\'t have to show off. Power is confident, self-assuring, self-starting and\nself-stopping, self-warming and self-justifying. When you have it, you know it.\nLet the Negroes snicker and the crackers laugh! Those are the facts, son. The\nonly ones I even pretend to please are big white folk, and even those I\ncontrol more than they control me. This is a power set-up, son, and I\'m at\nthe controls. You think about that. When you buck against me, you\'re bucking\nagainst power, rich white folk\'s power, the nation\'s power -- which means\ngovernment power!"\nHe paused to let it sink in and I waited, feeling a numb, violent\noutrage.\n"And I\'ll tell you something your sociology teachers are afraid to tell\nyou," he said. "If there weren\'t men like me running schools like this, there\'d\nbe no South. Nor North, either. No, and there\'d be no country -- not as it is\ntoday. You think about that, son." He laughed. "With all your speechmaking\nand studying I thought you understood something. But you . . . All right, go\nahead. See Norton. You\'ll find that he wants you disciplined; he might not\nknow it, but he does. Because he knows that I know what is best for his\ninterests. You\'re a black educated fool, son. These white folk have newspapers,\nmagazines, radios, spokesmen to get their ideas across. If they want to tell\nthe world a lie, they can tell it so well that it becomes the truth; and if I tell\nthem that you\'re lying, they\'ll tell the world even if you prove you\'re telling\nthe truth. Because it\'s the kind of lie they want to hear . . ."\nI heard the high thin laugh again. "You\'re nobody, son. You don\'t\nexist -- can\'t you see that? The white folk tell everybody what to think --\nexcept men like me. I tell them; that\'s my life, telling white folk how to think\nabout the things I know about. Shocks you, doesn\'t it? Well, that\'s the way it\nis. It\'s a nasty deal and I don\'t always like it myself. But you listen to me: I\ndidn\'t make it, and I know that I can\'t change it. But I\'ve made my place in\nit and I\'ll have every Negro in the country hanging on tree limbs by morning\nif it means staying where I am."\nHe was looking me in the eye now, his voice charged and sincere, as\nthough uttering a confession, a fantastic revelation which I could neither\nbelieve nor deny. Cold drops of sweat moved at a glacier\'s pace down my\nspine . . .\n"I mean it, son," he said. "I had to be strong and purposeful to get\nwhere I am. I had to wait and plan and lick around . . . Yes, I had to act\nthe nigger!" he said, adding another fiery, "Yes!\n"I don\'t even insist that it was worth it, but now I\'m here and I\nmean to stay -- after you win the game, you take the prize and you keep it,\nprotect it; there\'s nothing else to do." He shrugged. "A man gets old winning\nhis place, son. So you go ahead, go tell your story; match your truth against\nmy truth, because what I\'ve said is truth, the broader truth. Test it, try it out\n. . . When I started out I was a young fellow . . ."\nBut I no longer listened, nor saw more than the play of light upon\nthe metallic disks of his glasses, which now seemed to float within the\ndisgusting sea of his words. Truth, truth, what was truth? Nobody I knew,\nnot even my own mother, would believe me if I tried to tell them. Nor would\nI tomorrow, I thought, nor would I . . . I gazed helplessly at the grain of the\ndesk, then past his head to the case of loving cups behind his chair. Above\nthe case a portrait of the Founder looked noncommittally down.\n"Hee, hee!" Bledsoe laughed. "Your arms are too short to box with\nme, son. And I haven\'t had to really clip a young Negro in years. No," he\nsaid getting up, "they haven\'t been so cocky as they used to."\nThis time I could barely move, my stomach was knotted and my\nkidneys ached. My legs were rubbery. For three years I had thought of myself\nas a man and here with a few words he\'d made me as helpless as an infant.\nI pulled myself up . . .\n"Wait, hold on a second," he said, looking at me like a man about to\nflip a coin. "I like your spirit, son. You\'re a fighter, and I like that; you just\nlack judgment, though lack of judgment can ruin you. That\'s why I have to\npenalize you, son. I know how you feel, too. You don\'t want to go home to\nbe humiliated, I understand that, because you have some vague notions about\ndignity. In spite of me, such notions seep in along with the gimcrack teachers\nand northern-trained idealists. Yes, and you have some white folk backing you\nand you don\'t want to face them because nothing is worse for a black man\nthan to be humiliated by white folk. I know all about that too; ole doc\'s been\n\'buked and scorned and all of that. I don\'t just sing about it in chapel, I\nknow about it. But you\'ll get over it; it\'s foolish and expensive and a lot of\ndead weight. You let the white folk worry about pride and dignity -- you\nlearn where you are and get yourself power, influence, contacts with powerful\nand influential people -- then stay in the dark and use it!"\nHow long will I stand here and let him laugh at me, I thought,\nholding on to the back of the chair, how long?\n"You\'re a nervy little fighter, son," he said, "and the race needs good,\nsmart, disillusioned fighters. Therefore I\'m going to give you a hand -- maybe\nyou\'ll feel that I\'m giving you my left hand after I\'ve struck you with my\nright -- if you think I\'m the kind of man who\'d lead with his right, which\nI\'m most certainly not. But that\'s all right too, take it or leave it. I want you\nto go to New York for the summer and save your pride -- and your money.\nYou go there and earn your next year\'s fees, understand?"\nI nodded, unable to speak, whirling about furiously within myself,\ntrying to deal with him, to fit what he was saying to what he had said . . .\n"I\'ll give you letters to some of the school\'s friends to see that you\nget work," he said. "But this time, use your judgment, keep your eyes open,\nget in the swing of things! Then, if you make good, perhaps . . . well,\nperhaps . . . It\'s up to you."\nHis voice stopped as he stood, tall and black and disk-eyed, huge.\n"That\'s all, young man," he said, his tone abrupt, official. "You have\ntwo days in which to close your affairs."\n"Two days?"\n"Two days!" he said.\nI went down the steps and up the walk in the dark, making it out of\nthe building just before it bent me double beneath the wisteria that hung\nfrom the trees on rope-like vines. Almost a total disembowelment and when it\npaused I looked up through the trees arched high and cool above me to see\na whirling, double-imaged moon. My eyes were out of focus. I started toward\nmy room, covering one eye with my hand to avoid crashing into trees and\nlampposts projected into my path. I went on, tasting bile and thankful that it\nwas night with no one to witness my condition. My stomach felt raw. From\nsomewhere across the quiet of the campus the sound of an old guitar-blues\nplucked from an out-of-tune piano drifted toward me like a lazy, shimmering\nwave, like the echoed whistle of a lonely train, and my head went over again,\nagainst a tree this time, and I could hear it splattering the flowering vines.\nWhen I could move, my head started to whirl in a circle. The day\'s\nevents flowed past. Trueblood, Mr. Norton, Dr. Bledsoe and the Golden Day\nswept around my mind in a mad surreal whirl. I stood in the path holding\nmy eye and trying to push back the day, but each time I floundered upon\nDr. Bledsoe\'s decision. It still echoed in my mind and it was real and it was\nfinal. Whatever my responsibility was for what had occurred, I knew that I\nwould pay for it, knew that I would be expelled, and the very idea stabbed\nmy insides again. I stood there on the moonlit walk, trying to think ahead to\nits effects, imagining the satisfaction of those who envied my success, the\nshame and disappointment of my parents. I would never live down my\ndisgrace. My white friends would be disgusted and I recalled the fear that\nhung over all those who had no protection from powerful whites.\nHow had I come to this? I had kept unswervingly to the path placed\nbefore me, had tried to be exactly what I was expected to be, had done\nexactly what I was expected to do -- yet, instead of winning the expected\nreward, here I was stumbling along, holding on desperately to one of my eyes\nin order to keep from bursting out my brain against some familiar object\nswerved into my path by my distorted vision. And now to drive me wild I\nfelt suddenly that my grandfather was hovering over me, grinning\ntriumphantly out of the dark. I simply could not endure it. For, despite my\nanguish and anger, I knew of no other way of living, nor other forms of\nsuccess available to such as me. I was so completely a part of that existence\nthat in the end I had to make my peace. It was either that or admit that my\ngrandfather had made sense. Which was impossible, for though I still believed\nmyself innocent, I saw that the only alternative to permanently facing the\nworld of Trueblood and the Golden Day was to accept the responsibility for\nwhat had happened. Somehow, I convinced myself, I had violated the code\nand thus would have to submit to punishment. Dr. Bledsoe is right, I told\nmyself, he\'s right; the school and what it stands for have to be protected.\nThere was no other way, and no matter how much I suffered I would pay my\ndebt as quickly as possible and return to building my career . . .\nBack in my room I counted my savings, some fifty dollars, and\ndecided to get to New York as quickly as possible. If Dr. Bledsoe didn\'t\nchange his mind about helping me get a job, it would be enough to pay my\nroom and board at Men\'s House, about which I had learned from fellows who\nlived there during their summer vacations. I would leave in the morning.\nSo while my roommate grinned and mumbled unaware in his sleep I\npacked my bags.\nNEXT morning I was up before the bugle sounded and already on a\nbench in Dr. Bledsoe\'s outer office when he appeared. The jacket of his blue\nserge suit was open, revealing a heavy gold chain linked between his vest\npockets as he moved toward me with a noiseless tread. He passed without\nseeming to see me. Then as he reached his office door he said, "I haven\'t\nchanged my mind about you, boy. And I don\'t intend to!"\n"Oh, I didn\'t come for that, sir," I said, seeing him turn quickly,\nlooking down upon me, his eyes quizzical.\n"Very well, as long as you understand that. Come in and state your\nbusiness. I have work to do."\nI waited before the desk, watching him place his homburg on an old\nbrass hall-tree. Then he sat before me, making a cage of his fingers and\nnodding for me to begin.\nMy eyes burned and my voice sounded unreal. "I\'d like to leave this\nmorning, sir," I said.\nHis eyes retreated. "Why this morning?" he said. "I gave you until\ntomorrow. Why the hurry?"\n"It isn\'t hurry, sir. But since I have to leave I\'d like to get going.\nStaying until tomorrow won\'t change matters . . ."\n"No, it won\'t," he said. "That\'s good sense and you have my\npermission. And what else?"\n"That\'s all, sir, except that I want to say that I\'m sorry for what I\ndid and that I hold no hard feelings. What I did was unintentional, but I\'m\nin agreement with my punishment."\nHe touched his fingertips together, the thick fingers meeting\ndelicately, his face without expression. "That\'s the proper attitude," he said.\n"In other words, you don\'t intend to become bitter, is that it?"\n"Yes, sir."\n"Yes, I can see that you\'re beginning to learn. That\'s good. Two\nthings our people must do is accept responsibility for their acts and avoid\nbecoming bitter." His voice rose with the conviction of his chapel speeches.\n"Son, if you don\'t become bitter, nothing can stop you from success.\nRemember that."\n"I shall, sir," I said. Then my throat thickened and I hoped he would\nbring up the matter of a job himself.\nInstead, he looked at me impatiently and said, "Well? I have work to\ndo. My permission is granted."\n"Well, sir, I\'d like to ask a favor of you . . ."\n"Favor," he said shrewdly. "Now that\'s another matter. What kind of\nfavor?"\n"It isn\'t much, sir. You suggested that you would put me in touch\nwith some of the trustees who would give me a job. I\'m willing to do\nanything."\n"Oh, yes," he said, "yes, of course." .\nHe seemed to think for a moment, his eyes studying the objects on\nhis desk. Then touching the shackle gently with his index finger, he said,\n"Very well. When do you intend to leave?"\n"By the first bus, if possible, sir."\n"Are you packed?"\n"Yes, sir."\n"Very well. Go get your bags and return here in thirty minutes. My\nsecretary will give you some letters addressed to several friends of the school.\nOne of them will do something for you."\n"Thanks, sir. Thank you very much," I said as he stood.\n"That\'s all right," he said. "The school tries to look out for its own.\nOnly one thing more. These letters will be sealed; don\'t open them if you\nwant help. White folk are strict about such things. The letters will introduce\nyou and request them to help you with a job. I\'ll do my best for you and it\nisn\'t necessary for you to open them, understand?"\n"Oh, I wouldn\'t think of opening them, sir," I said.\n"Very well, the young lady will have them for you when you return.\nWhat about your parents, have you informed them?"\n"No, sir, it might make them feel too bad if I told them I was\nexpelled, so I plan to write them after I get there and get a job . . ."\n"I see. Perhaps that is best."\n"Well, good-bye, sir," I said, extending my hand.\n"Good-bye," he said. His hand was large and strangely limp.\nHe pressed a buzzer as I turned to leave. His secretary brushed past\nme as I went through the door.\nThe letters were waiting when I returned, seven of them, addressed\nto men with impressive names. I looked for Mr. Norton\'s but his was not\namong them. Placing them carefully in my inside pocket, I grabbed my bags\nand hurried for the bus.\nChapter 7\nThe station was empty, but the ticket window was open and a porter\nin a gray uniform was pushing a broom. I bought my ticket and climbed into\nthe bus. There were only two passengers seated at the rear of the red and\nnickel interior, and I suddenly felt that I was dreaming. It was the vet, who\ngave me a smile of recognition; an attendant sat beside him.\n"Welcome, young man," he called. "Imagine, Mr. Crenshaw," he said\nto the attendant, "we have a traveling companion!"\n"Morning," I said reluctantly. I looked around for a seat away from\nthem, but although the bus was almost empty, only the rear was reserved for\nus and there was nothing to do but move back with them. I didn\'t like it;\nthe vet was too much a part of an experience which I was already trying to\nblot out of my consciousness. His way of talking to Mr. Norton had been a\nforeshadowing of my misfortune -- just as I had sensed that it would be.\nNow having accepted my punishment, I wanted to remember nothing\nconnected with Trueblood or the Golden Day.\nCrenshaw, a much smaller man than Supercargo, said nothing. He\nwas not the type usually sent out to accompany violent cases and I was glad\nuntil I remembered that the only violent thing about the vet was his tongue.\nHis mouth had already gotten me into trouble and now I hoped he wouldn\'t\nturn it upon the white driver -- that was apt to get us killed. What was he\ndoing on the bus anyway? God, how had Dr. Bledsoe worked that fast? I\nstared at the fat man.\n"How did your friend Mr. Norton make out?" he asked.\n"He\'s okay," I said.\n"No more fainting spells?"\n"No."\n"Did he bawl you out for what happened?"\n"He didn\'t blame me," I said.\n"Good. I think I shocked him more than anything else he saw at the\nGolden Day. I hoped I hadn\'t caused you trouble. School isn\'t out so soon, is\nit?"\n"Not quite," I said lightly. "I\'m leaving early in order to take a job."\n"Wonderful! At home?"\n"No, I thought I might make more money in New York."\n"New York!" he said. "That\'s not a place, it\'s a dream. When I was\nyour age it was Chicago. Now all the little black boys run away to New York.\nOut of the fire into the melting pot. I can see you after you\'ve lived in\nHarlem for three months. Your speech will change, you\'ll talk a lot about\n\'college,\' you\'ll attend lectures at the Men\'s House . . . you might even meet\na few white folks. And listen," he said, leaning close to whisper, "you might\neven dance with a white girl!"\n"I\'m going to New York to work," I said, looking around me. "I won\'t\nhave time for that."\n"You will though," he teased. "Deep down you\'re thinking about the\nfreedom you\'ve heard about up North, and you\'ll try it once, just to see if\nwhat you\'ve heard is true."\n"There\'s other kinds of freedom beside some ole white trash women,"\nCrenshaw said. "He might want to see him some shows and eat in some of\nthem big restaurants."\nThe vet grinned. "Why, of course, but remember, Crenshaw, he\'s only\ngoing to be there a few months. Most of the time he\'ll be working, and so\nmuch of his freedom will have to be symbolic. And what will be his or any\nman\'s most easily accessible symbol of freedom? Why, a woman, of course. In\ntwenty minutes he can inflate that symbol with all the freedom which he\'ll be\ntoo busy working to enjoy the rest of the time. He\'ll see."\nI tried to change the subject. "Where are you going?" I asked.\n"To Washington, D. C.," he said.\n"Then you\'re cured?"\n"Cured? There is no cure --"\n"He\'s being transferred," said Crenshaw.\n"Yes, I\'m headed for St. Elizabeth\'s," the vet said. "The ways of\nauthority are indeed mysterious. For a year I\'ve tried to get transferred, then\nthis morning I\'m suddenly told to pack. I can\'t but wonder if our little\nconversation with your friend Mr. Norton had something to do with it."\n"How could he have anything to do with it?" I said, remembering Dr.\nBledsoe\'s threat.\n"How could he have anything to do with your being on this bus?" he\nsaid.\nHe winked. His eyes twinkled. "All right, forget what I\'ve said. But\nfor God\'s sake, learn to look beneath the surface," he said. "Come out of the\nfog, young man. And remember you don\'t have to be a complete fool in\norder to succeed. Play the game, but don\'t believe in it -- that much you owe\nyourself. Even if it lands you in a strait jacket or a padded cell. Play the\ngame, but play it your own way -- part of the time at least. Play the game,\nbut raise the ante, my boy. Learn how it operates, learn how you operate -- I\nwish I had time to tell you only a fragment. We\'re an ass-backward people,\nthough. You might even beat the game. It\'s really a very crude affair. Really\nPre-Renaissance -- and that game has been analyzed, put down in books. But\ndown here they\'ve forgotten to take care of the books and that\'s your\nopportunity. You\'re hidden right out in the open -- that is, you would be if\nyou only realized it. They wouldn\'t see you because they don\'t expect you to\nknow anything, since they believe they\'ve taken care of that . . ."\n"Man, who\'s this they you talking so much about?" said Crenshaw.\nThe vet looked annoyed. "They?" he said. "They? Why, the same they\nwe always mean, the white folks, authority, the gods, fate, circumstances --\nthe force that pulls your strings until you refuse to be pulled any more. The\nbig man who\'s never there, where you think he is."\nCrenshaw grimaced. "You talk too damn much, man," he said. "You\ntalk and you don\'t say nothing."\n"Oh, I have a lot to say, Crenshaw. I put into words things which\nmost men feel, if only slightly. Sure, I\'m a compulsive talker of a kind, but\nI\'m really more clown than fool. But, Crenshaw," he said, rolling a wand of\nthe newspaper which lay across his knees, "you don\'t realize what\'s\nhappening. Our young friend is going North for the first time! It is for the\nfirst time, isn\'t it?"\n"You\'re right," I said.\n"Of course. Were you ever North before, Crenshaw?"\n"I been all over the country," Crenshaw said. "I know how they do it,\nwherever they do it. And I know how to act too. Besides, you ain\'t going\nNorth, not the real North. You going to Washington. It\'s just another\nsouthern town."\n"Yes, I know," the vet said, "but think of what this means for the\nyoung fellow. He\'s going free, in the broad daylight and alone. I can\nremember when young fellows like him had first to commit a crime, or be\naccused of one, before they tried such a thing. Instead of leaving in the light\nof morning, they went in the dark of night. And no bus was fast enough --\nisn\'t that so, Crenshaw?"\nCrenshaw stopped unwrapping a candy bar and looked at him\nsharply, his eyes narrowed. "How the hell I know?" he said.\n"I\'m sorry, Crenshaw," the vet said. "I thought that as a man of\nexperience . . ."\n"Well, I ain\'t had that experience. I went North of my own free will."\n"But haven\'t you heard of such cases?"\n"Hearing ain\'t \'speriencing," Crenshaw said.\n"No, it isn\'t. But since there\'s always an element of crime in freedom\n--"\n"I ain\'t committed no crime!"\n"I didn\'t mean that you had," the vet said. "I apologize. Forget it."\nCrenshaw took an angry bite from his candy bar, mumbling, "I wish\nyou\'d hurry up and git depressive, maybe then you won\'t talk so damn\nmuch."\n"Yes, doctor," the vet said mockingly. "I\'ll be depressive soon enough,\nbut while you eat your candy just allow me to chew the rag; there\'s a kind of\nsubstance in it."\n"Aw, quit trying to show off your education," Crenshaw said. "You\nriding back here in the Jim Crow just like me. Besides, you\'re a nut."\nThe vet winked at me, continuing his flow of words as the bus got\nunder way. We were going at last and I took a last longing look as the bus\nshot around the highway which circled the school. I turned and watched it\nrecede from the rear window; the sun caught its treetops, bathed its low-set\nbuildings and ordered grounds. Then it was gone. In less than five minutes\nthe spot of earth which I identified with the best of all possible worlds was\ngone, lost within the wild uncultivated countryside. A flash of movement drew\nmy eye to the side of the highway now, and I saw a moccasin wiggle swiftly\nalong the gray concrete, vanishing into a length of iron pipe that lay beside\nthe road. I watched the flashing past of cotton fields and cabins, feeling that\nI was moving into the unknown.\nThe vet and Crenshaw prepared to change busses at the next stop,\nand upon leaving, the vet placed his hand upon my shoulder and looked at\nme with kindness, and, as always, he smiled.\n"Now is the time for offering fatherly advice," he said, "but I\'ll have\nto spare you that -- since I guess I\'m nobody\'s father except my own.\nPerhaps that\'s the advice to give you: Be your own father, young man. And\nremember, the world is possibility if only you\'ll discover it. Last of all, leave\nthe Mr. Nortons alone, and if you don\'t know what I mean, think about it.\nFarewell."\nI watched him following Crenshaw through the group of passengers\nwaiting to get on, a short, comical figure turning to wave, then disappearing\nthrough the door of the red brick terminal. I sat back with a sigh of relief,\nyet once the passengers were aboard and the bus under way again, I felt sad\nand utterly alone.\nNOT until we were sailing through the Jersey countryside did my\nspirits begin to rise. Then my old confidence and optimism revived, and I\ntried to plan my time in the North. I would work hard and serve my\nemployer so well that he would shower Dr. Bledsoe with favorable reports.\nAnd I would save my money and return in the fall full of New York culture.\nI\'d be indisputably the leading campus figure. Perhaps I would attend Town\nMeeting, which I had heard over the radio. I\'d learn the platform tricks of\nthe leading speakers. And I would make the best of my contacts. When I met\nthe big men to whom my letters were addressed I would put on my best\nmanner. I would speak softly, in my most polished tones, smile agreeably and\nbe most polite; and I would remember that if he ("he" meant any of the\nimportant gentlemen) should begin a topic of conversation (I would never\nbegin a subject of my own) which I found unfamiliar, I would smile and\nagree. My shoes would be polished, my suit pressed, my hair dressed (not too\nmuch grease) and parted on the right side; my nails would be clean and my\narmpits well deodorized -- you had to watch the last item. You couldn\'t allow\nthem to think all of us smelled bad. The very thought of my contacts gave\nme a feeling of sophistication, of worldliness, which, as I fingered the seven\nimportant letters in my pocket, made me feel light and expansive.\nI dreamed with my eyes gazing blankly upon the landscape until I\nlooked up to see a Red Cap frowning down. "Buddy, are you getting off\nhere?" he said. "If so, you better get started."\n"Oh, sure," I said, beginning to move. "Sure, but how do you get to\nHarlem?"\n"That\'s easy," he said. "You just keep heading north."\nAnd while I got down my bags and my prize brief case, still as shiny\nas the night of the battle royal, he instructed me how to take the subway,\nthen I struggled through the crowd.\nMoving into the subway I was pushed along by the milling\nsalt-and-pepper mob, seized in the back by a burly, blue-uniformed attendant\nabout the size of Supercargo, and crammed, bags and all, into a train that\nwas so crowded that everyone seemed to stand with his head back and his\neyes bulging, like chickens frozen at the sound of danger. Then the door\nbanged behind me and I was crushed against a huge woman in black who\nshook her head and smiled while I stared with horror at a large mole that\narose out of the oily whiteness of her skin like a black mountain sweeping\nout of a rainwet plain. And all the while I could feel the rubbery softness of\nher flesh against the length of my body. I could neither turn sideways nor\nback away, nor set down my bags. I was trapped, so close that simply by\nnodding my head, I might have brushed her lips with mine. I wanted\ndesperately to raise my hands to show her that it was against my will. I kept\nexpecting her to scream, until finally the car lurched and I was able to free\nmy left arm. I closed my eyes, holding desperately to my lapel. The car\nroared and swayed, pressing me hard against her, but when I took a furtive\nglance around no one was paying me the slightest attention. And even she\nseemed lost in her own thoughts. The train seemed to plunge downhill now,\nonly to lunge to a stop that shot me out upon a platform feeling like\nsomething regurgitated from the belly of a frantic whale. Wrestling with my\nbags, I swept along with the crowd, up the stairs into the hot street. I didn\'t\ncare where I was, I would walk the rest of the way.\nFor a moment I stood before a shop window staring at my own\nreflection in the glass, trying to recover from the ride against the woman. I\nwas limp, my clothing wet. "But you\'re up North now," I told myself, "up\nNorth." Yes, but suppose she had screamed . . . The next time I used the\nsubway I\'d always be sure to enter with my hands grasping my lapels and I\'d\nkeep them there until I left the train. Why, my God, they must have riots on\nthose things all the time. Why hadn\'t I read about them?\nI had never seen so many black people against a background of brick\nbuildings, neon signs, plate glass and roaring traffic -- not even on trips I\nhad made with the debating team to New Orleans, Dallas or Birmingham.\nThey were everywhere. So many, and moving along with so much tension and\nnoise that I wasn\'t sure whether they were about to celebrate a holiday or\njoin in a street fight. There were even black girls behind the counters of the\nFive and Ten as I passed. Then at the street intersection I had the shock of\nseeing a black policeman directing traffic -- and there were white drivers in\nthe traffic who obeyed his signals as though it was the most natural thing in\nthe world. Sure I had heard of it, but this was real. My courage returned.\nThis really was Harlem, and now all the stories which I had heard of the\ncity-within-a-city leaped alive in my mind. The vet had been right: For me\nthis was not a city of realities, but of dreams; perhaps because I had always\nthought of my life as being confined to the South. And now as I struggled\nthrough the lines of people a new world of possibility suggested itself to me\nfaintly, like a small voice that was barely audible in the roar of city sounds. I\nmoved wide-eyed, trying to take the bombardment of impressions. Then I\nstopped still.\nIt was ahead of me, angry and shrill, and upon hearing it I had a\nsensation of shock and fear such as I had felt as a child when surprised by\nmy father\'s voice. An emptiness widened in my stomach. Before me a\ngathering of people were almost blocking the walk, while above them a short\nsquat man shouted angrily from a ladder to which were attached a collection\nof small American flags.\n"We gine chase \'em out," the man cried. "Out!"\n"Tell \'em about it, Ras, mahn," a voice called.\nAnd I saw the squat man shake his fist angrily over the uplifted\nfaces, yelling something in a staccato West Indian accent, at which the crowd\nyelled threateningly. It was as though a riot would break any minute, against\nwhom I didn\'t know. I was puzzled, both by the effect of his voice upon me\nand by the obvious anger of the crowd. I had never seen so many black men\nangry in public before, and yet others passed the gathering by without even a\nglance. And as I came alongside, I saw two white policemen talking quietly\nwith one another, their backs turned as they laughed at some joke. Even\nwhen the shirt-sleeved crowd cried out in angry affirmation of some remark\nof the speaker, they paid no attention. I was stunned. I stood gaping at the\npolicemen, my bags settling upon the middle of the walk, until one of them\nhappened to see me and nudged the other, who chewed lazily upon a wad of\ngum.\n"What can we do for you, bud?" he said.\n"I was just wondering . . ." I said, before I caught myself.\n"Yeah?"\n"I was just wondering how to get to Men\'s House, sir," I said.\n"Is that all?"\n"Yes, sir," I stammered.\n"You sure?"\n"Yes, sir."\n"He\'s a stranger," the other said. "Just coming to town, bud?"\n"Yes, sir," I said, "I just got off the subway."\n"You did, huh? Well, you want to be careful."\n"Oh, I will, sir."\n"That\'s the idea. Keep it clean," he said, and directed me to Men\'s\nHouse.\nI thanked them and hurried on. The speaker had become more\nviolent than before and his remarks were about the government. The clash\nbetween the calm of the rest of the street and the passion of the voice gave\nthe scene a strange out-of-joint quality, and I was careful not to look back\nlest I see a riot flare.\nI reached Men\'s House in a sweat, registered, and went immediately\nto my room. I would have to take Harlem a little at a time.\nChapter 8\nIt was a clean little room with a dark orange bedspread. The chair\nand dresser were maple and there was a Gideon Bible lying upon a small\ntable. I dropped my bags and sat on the bed. From the street below came\nthe sound of traffic, the larger sound of the subway, the smaller, more varied\nsounds of voices. Alone in the room, I could hardly believe that I was so far\naway from home, yet there was nothing familiar in my surroundings. Except\nthe Bible; I picked it up and sat back on the bed, allowing its\nblood-red-edged pages to ripple beneath my thumb. I remembered how Dr.\nBledsoe could quote from the Book during his speeches to the student body\non Sunday nights. I turned to the book of Genesis, but could not read. I\nthought of home and the attempts my father had made to institute family\nprayer, the gathering around the stove at mealtime and kneeling with heads\nbowed over the seats of our chairs, his voice quavering and full of\nchurch-house rhetoric and verbal humility. But this made me homesick and I\nput the Bible aside. This was New York. I had to get a job and earn money.\nI took off my coat and hat and took my packet of letters and lay\nback upon the bed, drawing a feeling of importance from reading the\nimportant names. What was inside, and how could I open them undetected?\nThey were tightly sealed. I had read that letters were sometimes steamed\nopen, but I had no steam. I gave it up, I really didn\'t need to know their\ncontents and it would not be honorable or safe to tamper with Dr. Bledsoe. I\nknew already that they concerned me and were addressed to some of the\nmost important men in the whole country. That was enough. I caught myself\nwishing for someone to show the letters to, someone who could give me a\nproper reflection of my importance. Finally, I went to the mirror and gave\nmyself an admiring smile as I spread the letters upon the dresser like a hand\nof high trump cards.\nThen I began to map my campaign for the next day. First, I would\nhave a shower, then get breakfast. All this very early. I\'d have to move fast.\nWith important men like that you had to be on time. If you made an\nappointment with one of them, you couldn\'t bring them any slow c.p. (colored\npeople\'s) time. Yes, and I would have to get a watch. I would do everything\nto schedule. I recalled the heavy gold chain that hung between Dr. Bledsoe\'s\nvest pockets and the air with which he snapped his watch open to consult\nthe time, his lips pursed, chin pulled in so that it multiplied, his forehead\nwrinkled. Then he\'d clear his throat and give a deeply intoned order, as\nthough each syllable were pregnant with nuances of profoundly important\nmeaning. I recalled my expulsion, feeling quick anger and attempting to\nsuppress it immediately; but now I was not quite successful, my resentment\nstuck out at the edges, making me uncomfortable. Maybe it was best, I\nthought hastily. Maybe if it hadn\'t happened I would never have received an\nopportunity to meet such important men face to face. In my mind\'s eye I\ncontinued to see him gazing into his watch, but now he was joined by\nanother figure; a younger figure, myself; become shrewd, suave and dressed\nnot in somber garments (like his old-fashioned ones) but in a dapper suit of\nrich material, cut fashionably, like those of the men you saw in magazine ads,\nthe junior executive types in Esquire. I imagined myself making a speech and\ncaught in striking poses by flashing cameras, snapped at the end of some\nperiod of dazzling eloquence. A younger version of the doctor, less crude,\nindeed polished. I would hardly ever speak above a whisper and I would\nalways be -- yes, there was no other word, I would be charming. Like Ronald\nColman. What a voice! Of course you couldn\'t speak that way in the South,\nthe white folks wouldn\'t like it, and the Negroes would say that you were\n"putting on." But here in the North I would slough off my southern ways of\nspeech. Indeed, I would have one way of speaking in the North and another\nin the South. Give them what they wanted down South, that was the way. If\nDr. Bledsoe could do it, so could I. Before going to bed that night I wiped\noff my brief case with a clean towel and placed the letters carefully inside.\nThe next morning I took an early subway into the Wall Street\ndistrict, selecting an address that carried me almost to the end of the island.\nIt was dark with the tallness of the buildings and the narrow streets.\nArmored cars with alert guards went past as I looked for the number. The\nstreets were full of hurrying people who walked as though they had been\nwound up and were directed by some unseen control. Many of the men\ncarried dispatch cases and brief cases and I gripped mine with a sense of\nimportance. And here and there I saw Negroes who hurried along with\nleather pouches strapped to their wrists. They reminded me fleetingly of\nprisoners carrying their leg irons as they escaped from a chain gang. Yet they\nseemed aware of some self-importance, and I wished to stop one and ask him\nwhy he was chained to his pouch. Maybe they got paid well for this, maybe\nthey were chained to money. Perhaps the man with rundown heels ahead of\nme was chained to a million dollars!\nI looked to see if there were policemen or detectives with drawn\nguns following, but there was no one. Or if so, they were hidden in the\nhurrying crowd. I wanted to follow one of the men to see where he was\ngoing. Why did they trust him with all that money? And what would happen\nif he should disappear with it? But of course no one would be that foolish.\nThis was Wall Street. Perhaps it was guarded, as I had been told post offices\nwere guarded, by men who looked down at you through peepholes in the\nceiling and walls, watching you constantly, silently waiting for a wrong move.\nPerhaps even now an eye had picked me up and watched my every\nmovement. Maybe the face of that clock set in the gray building across the\nstreet hid a pair of searching eyes. I hurried to my address and was\nchallenged by the sheer height of the white stone with its sculptured bronze\nfa?de. Men and women hurried inside, and after staring for a moment I\nfollowed, taking the elevator and being pushed to the back of the car. It rose\nlike a rocket, creating a sensation in my crotch as though an important part\nof myself had been left below in the lobby.\nAt the last stop I left the car and went down a stretch of marble\nhallway until I found the door marked with the trustee\'s name. But starting\nto enter I lost my nerve and backed away. I looked down the hall. It was\nempty. White folks were funny; Mr. Bates might not wish to see a Negro the\nfirst thing in the morning. I turned and walked down the hall and looked out\nof the window. I would wait awhile.\nBelow me lay South Ferry, and a ship and two barges were passing\nout into the river, and far out and to the right I could make out the Statue\nof Liberty, her torch almost lost in the fog. Back along the shore, gulls soared\nthrough the mist above the docks, and down, so far below that it made me\ndizzy, crowds were moving. I looked back to a ferry passing the Statue of\nLiberty now, its backwash a curving line upon the bay and three gulls\nswooping down behind it.\nBehind me the elevator was letting off passengers, and I heard the\ncheery voices of women going chattering down the hall. Soon I would have to\ngo in. My uncertainty grew. My appearance worried me. Mr. Bates might not\nlike my suit, or the cut of my hair, and my chance of a job would be lost. I\nlooked at his name typed neatly across the envelope and wondered how he\nearned his money. He was a millionaire, I knew. Maybe he had always been;\nmaybe he was born a millionaire. Never before had I been so curious about\nmoney as now that I believed I was surrounded by it. Perhaps I would get a\njob here and after a few years would be sent up and down the streets with\nmillions strapped to my arms, a trusted messenger. Then I\'d be sent South\nagain to head the college -- just as the mayor\'s cook had been made principal\nof the school after she\'d become too lame to stand before her stove. Only I\nwouldn\'t stay North that long; they\'d need me before that . . . But now for\nthe interview.\nEntering the office I found myself face to face with a young woman\nwho looked up from her desk as I glanced swiftly over the large light room,\nover the comfortable chairs, the ceiling-high bookcases with gold and leather\nbindings, past a series of portraits and back again, to meet her questioning\neyes. She was alone and I thought, Well, at least I\'m not too early . . .\n"Good morning," she said, betraying none of the antagonism I had\nexpected.\n"Good morning," I said, advancing. How should I begin?\n"Yes?"\n"Is this Mr. Bates\' office?" I said.\n"Why, yes, it is," she said. "Have you an appointment?"\n"No, ma\'m," I said, and quickly hated myself for saying "ma\'m" to so\nyoung a white woman, and in the North too. I removed the letter from my\nbrief case, but before I could explain, she said,\n"May I see it, please?"\nI hesitated. I did not wish to surrender the letter except to Mr.\nBates, but there was a command in the extended hand, and I obeyed. I\nsurrendered it, expecting her to open it, but instead, after looking at the\nenvelope she rose and disappeared behind a paneled door without a word.\nBack across the expanse of carpet to the door which I had entered I\nnoticed several chairs but was undecided to go there. I stood, my hat in my\nhand, looking around me. One wall caught my eyes. It was hung with three\nportraits of dignified old gentlemen in winged collars who looked down from\ntheir frames with an assurance and arrogance that I had never seen in any\nexcept white men and a few bad, razor-scarred Negroes. Not even Dr.\nBledsoe, who had but to look around him without speaking to set the\nteachers to trembling, had such assurance. So these were the kind of men\nwho stood behind him. How did they fit in with the southern white folks,\nwith the men who gave me my scholarship? I was still staring, caught in the\nspell of power and mystery, when the secretary returned.\nShe looked at me oddly and smiled. "I\'m very sorry," she said, "but\nMr. Bates is just too busy to see you this morning and asks that you leave\nyour name and address. You\'ll hear from him by mail."\nI stood silent with disappointment. "Write it here," she said, giving\nme a card.\n"I\'m sorry," she said again as I scribbled my address and prepared to\nleave.\n"I can be reached here at any time," I said.\n"Very good," she said. "You should hear very soon."\nShe seemed very kind and interested, and I left in good spirits. My\nfears were groundless, there was nothing to it. This was New York.\nI succeeded in reaching several trustees\' secretaries during the days\nthat followed, and all were friendly and encouraging. Some looked at me\nstrangely, but I dismissed it since it didn\'t appear to be antagonism. Perhaps\nthey\'re surprised to see someone like me with introductions to such important\nmen, I thought. Well, there were unseen lines that ran from North to South,\nand Mr. Norton had called me his destiny . . . I swung my brief case with\nconfidence.\nWith things going so well I distributed my letters in the mornings,\nand saw the city during the afternoons. Walking about the streets, sitting on\nsubways beside whites, eating with them in the same cafeterias (although I\navoided their tables) gave me the eerie, out-of-focus sensation of a dream. My\nclothes felt ill-fitting; and for all my letters to men of power, I was unsure of\nhow I should act. For the first time, as I swung along the streets, I thought\nconsciously of how I had conducted myself at home. I hadn\'t worried too\nmuch about whites as people. Some were friendly and some were not, and\nyou tried not to offend either. But here they all seemed impersonal; and yet\nwhen most impersonal they startled me by being polite, by begging my\npardon after brushing against me in a crowd. Still I felt that even when they\nwere polite they hardly saw me, that they would have begged the pardon of\nJack the Bear, never glancing his way if the bear happened to be walking\nalong minding his business. It was confusing. I did not know if it was\ndesirable or undesirable . . .\nBut my main concern was seeing the trustees and after more than a\nweek of seeing the city and being vaguely encouraged by secretaries, I became\nimpatient. I had distributed all but the letter to a Mr. Emerson, who I knew\nfrom the papers was away from the city. Several times I started down to see\nwhat had happened but changed my mind. I did not wish to seem too\nimpatient. But time was becoming short. Unless I found work soon I would\nnever earn enough to enter school by fall. I had already written home that I\nwas working for a member of the trustee board, and the only letter I had\nreceived so far was one telling me how wonderful they thought it was and\nwarning me against the ways of the wicked city. Now I couldn\'t write them\nfor money without revealing that I had been lying about the job.\nFinally I tried to reach the important men by telephone, only to\nreceive polite refusals by their secretaries. But fortunately I still had the letter\nto Mr. Emerson. I decided to use it, but instead of handing it over to a\nsecretary, I wrote a letter explaining that I had a message from Dr. Bledsoe\nand requesting an appointment. Maybe I\'ve been wrong about the secretaries,\nI thought; maybe they destroyed the letters. I should have been more careful.\nI thought of Mr. Norton. If only the last letter had been addressed to\nhim. If only he lived in New York so that I could make a personal appeal!\nSomehow I felt closer to Mr. Norton, and felt that if he should see me, he\nwould remember that it was I whom he connected so closely to his fate. Now\nit seemed ages ago and in a different season and a distant land. Actually, it\nwas less than a month. I became energetic and wrote him a letter, expressing\nmy belief that my future would be immeasurably different if only I could\nwork for him; that he would be benefited as well as I. I was especially\ncareful to allow some indication of my ability to come through the appeal. I\nspent several hours on the typing, destroying copy after copy until I had\ncompleted one that was immaculate, carefully phrased and most respectful. I\nhurried down and posted it before the final mail collection, suddenly seized\nwith the dizzy conviction that it would bring results. I remained about the\nbuilding for three days awaiting an answer. But the letter brought no reply.\nNor, any more than a prayer unanswered by God, was it returned.\nMy doubts grew. Perhaps all was not well. I remained in my room\nall the next day. I grew conscious that I was afraid; more afraid here in my\nroom than I had ever been in the South. And all the more, because here\nthere was nothing concrete to lay it to. All the secretaries had been\nencouraging. In the evening I went out to a movie, a picture of frontier life\nwith heroic Indian fighting and struggles against flood, storm and forest fire,\nwith the out-numbered settlers winning each engagement; an epic of wagon\ntrains rolling ever westward. I forgot myself (although there was no one like\nme taking part in the adventures) and left the dark room in a lighter mood.\nBut that night I dreamed of my grandfather and awoke depressed. I walked\nout of the building with a queer feeling that I was playing a part in some\nscheme which I did not understand. Somehow I felt that Bledsoe and Norton\nwere behind it, and all day I was inhibited in both speech and conduct, for\nfear that I might say or do something scandalous. But this was all fantastic, I\ntold myself. I was being too impatient. I could wait for the trustees to make\na move. Perhaps I was being subjected to a test of some kind. They hadn\'t\ntold me the rules, I knew, but the feeling persisted. Perhaps my exile would\nend suddenly and I would be given a scholarship to return to the campus.\nBut when? How long?\nSomething had to happen soon. I would have to find a job to tide\nme over. My money was almost gone and anything might happen. I had been\nso confident that I had failed to put aside the price of train fare home. I was\nmiserable and I dared not talk to anyone about my problems; not even the\nofficials at Men\'s House, for since they had learned that I was to be assigned\nto an important job, they treated me with a certain deference; therefore I was\ncareful to hide my growing doubts. After all, I thought, I might have to ask\nfor credit and I\'ll have to appear a good risk. No, the thing to do was to\nkeep faith. I\'d start out once more in the morning. Something was certain to\nhappen tomorrow. And it did. I received a letter from Mr. Emerson.\nChapter 9\nIt was a clear, bright day when I went out, and the sun burned\nwarm upon my eyes. Only a few flecks of snowy cloud hung high in the\nmorning-blue sky, and already a woman was hanging wash on a roof. I felt\nbetter walking along. A feeling of confidence grew. Far down the island the\nskyscrapers rose tall and mysterious in the thin, pastel haze. A milk truck\nwent past. I thought of the school. What were they doing now on the\ncampus? Had the moon sunk low and the sun climbed clear? Had the\nbreakfast bugle blown? Did the bellow of the big seed bull awaken the girls\nin the dorms this morning as on most spring mornings when I was there --\nsounding clear and full above bells and bugles and early workaday sounds? I\nhurried along, encouraged by the memories, and suddenly I was seized with a\ncertainty that today was the day. Something would happen. I patted my brief\ncase, thinking of the letter inside. The last had been first -- a good sign.\nClose to the curb ahead I saw a man pushing a cart piled high with\nrolls of blue paper and heard him singing in a clear ringing voice. It was a\nblues, and I walked along behind him remembering the times that I had\nheard such singing at home. It seemed that here some memories slipped\naround my life at the campus and went far back to things I had long ago\nshut out of my mind. There was no escaping such reminders.\n"She\'s got feet like a monkey\nLegs like a frog -- Lawd, Lawd!\nBut when she starts to loving me\nI holler Whoooo, God-dog!\nCause I loves my baabay,\nBetter than I do myself . . ."\nAnd as I drew alongside I was startled to hear him call to me:\n"Looka-year, buddy . . ."\n"Yes," I said, pausing to look into his reddish eyes.\n"Tell me just one thing this very fine morning -- Hey! Wait a\nminute, daddy-o, I\'m going your way!"\n"What is it?" I said.\n"What I want to know is," he said, "is you got the dog?"\n"Dog? What dog?"\n"Sho," he said, stopping his cart and resting it on its support. "That\'s\nit. Who --" he halted to crouch with one foot on the curb like a country\npreacher about to pound his Bible -- "got . . . the . . . dog," his head\nsnapping with each word like an angry rooster\'s.\nI laughed nervously and stepped back. He watched me out of shrewd\neyes. "Oh, goddog, daddy-o," he said with a sudden bluster, "who got the\ndamn dog? Now I know you from down home, how come you trying to act\nlike you never heard that before! Hell, ain\'t nobody out here this morning but\nus colored -- Why you trying to deny me?"\nSuddenly I was embarrassed and angry. "Deny you? What do you\nmean?"\n"Just answer the question. Is you got him, or ain\'t you?"\n"A dog?"\n"Yeah, the dog."\nI was exasperated. "No, not this morning," I said and saw a grin\nspread over his face.\n"Wait a minute, daddy. Now don\'t go get mad. Damn, man! I\nthought sho you had him," he said, pretending to disbelieve me. I started\naway and he pushed the cart beside me. And suddenly I felt uncomfortable.\nSomehow he was like one of the vets from the Golden Day . . .\n"Well, maybe it\'s the other way round," he said. "Maybe he got holt\nto you."\n"Maybe," I said.\n"If he is, you lucky it\'s just a dog -- \'cause, man, I tell you I believe\nit\'s a bear that\'s got holt to me."\n"A bear?"\n"Hell, yes! The bear. Caint you see these patches where he\'s been\nclawing at my behind?"\nPulling the seat of his Charlie Chaplin pants to the side, he broke\ninto deep laughter.\n"Man, this Harlem ain\'t nothing but a bear\'s den. But I tell you one\nthing," he said with swiftly sobering face, "it\'s the best place in the world for\nyou and me, and if times don\'t get better soon I\'m going to grab that bear\nand turn him every way but loose!"\n"Don\'t let him get you down," I said.\n"No, daddy-o, I\'m going to start with one my own size!"\nI tried to think of some saying about bears to reply, but remembered\nonly Jack the Rabbit, Jack the Bear . . . who were both long forgotten and\nnow brought a wave of homesickness. I wanted to leave him, and yet I found\na certain comfort in walking along beside him, as though we\'d walked this\nway before through other mornings, in other places . . .\n"What is all that you have there?" I said, pointing to the rolls of\nblue paper stacked in the cart.\n"Blueprints, man. Here I got \'bout a hundred pounds of blueprints\nand I couldn\'t build nothing!"\n"What are they blueprints for?" I said.\n"Damn if I know -- everything. Cities, towns, country clubs. Some\njust buildings and houses. I got damn near enough to build me a house if I\ncould live in a paper house like they do in Japan. I guess somebody done\nchanged their plans," he added with a laugh. "I asked the man why they\ngetting rid of all this stuff and he said they get in the way so every once in\na while they have to throw \'em out to make place for the new plans. Plenty\nof these ain\'t never been used, you know."\n"You have quite a lot," I said.\n"Yeah, this ain\'t all neither. I got a coupla loads. There\'s a day\'s\nwork right here in this stuff. Folks is always making plans and changing \'em."\n"Yes, that\'s right," I said, thinking of my letters, "but that\'s a\nmistake. You have to stick to the plan."\nHe looked at me, suddenly grave. "You kinda young, daddy-o," he\nsaid.\nI did not answer. We came to a corner at the top of a hill.\n"Well, daddy-o, it\'s been good talking with a youngster from the old\ncountry but I got to leave you now. This here\'s one of them good ole\ndownhill streets. I can coast a while and won\'t be worn out at the end of the\nday. Damn if I\'m-a let \'em run me into my grave. I be seeing you again\nsometime -- And you know something?"\n"What\'s that?"\n"I thought you was trying to deny me at first, but now I be pretty\nglad to see you . . ."\n"I hope so," I said. "And you take it easy."\n"Oh, I\'ll do that. All it takes to get along in this here man\'s town is\na little shit, grit and mother-wit. And man, I was bawn with all three. In\nf a c t ,\nI\'maseventhsonofaseventhsonbawnwithacauloverbotheyesandraisedonblackcat-bon\neshighjohntheconquerorandgreasygreens --" he spieled with twinkling eyes, his\nlips working rapidly. "You dig me, daddy?"\n"You\'re going too fast," I said, beginning to laugh.\n"Okay, I\'m slowing down. I\'ll verse you but I won\'t curse you -- My\nname is Peter Wheatstraw, I\'m the Devil\'s only son-in-law, so roll \'em! You a\nsouthern boy, ain\'t you?" he said, his head to one side like a bear\'s.\n"Yes," I said.\n"Well, git with it! My name\'s Blue and I\'m coming at you with a\npitchfork. Fe Fi Fo Fum. Who wants to shoot the Devil one, Lord God\nStingeroy!"\nHe had me grinning despite myself. I liked his words though I didn\'t\nknow the answer. I\'d known the stuff from childhood, but had forgotten it;\nhad learned it back of school . . .\n"You digging me, daddy?" he laughed. "Haw, but look me up\nsometimes, I\'m a piano player and a rounder, a whiskey drinker and a\npavement pounder. I\'ll teach you some good bad habits. You\'ll need \'em.\nGood luck," he said.\n"So long," I said and watched him going. I watched him push around\nthe corner to the top of the hill leaning sharp against the cart handle, and\nheard his voice arise, muffled now, as he started down.\nShe\'s got feet like a monkeeee\nLegs\nLegs, Legs like a maaad\nBulldog . . .\nWhat does it mean, I thought. I\'d heard it all my life but suddenly\nthe strangeness of it came through to me. Was it about a woman or about\nsome strange sphinxlike animal? Certainly his woman, no woman, fitted that\ndescription. And why describe anyone in such contradictory words? Was it a\nsphinx? Did old Chaplin-pants, old dusty-butt, love her or hate her; or was\nhe merely singing? What kind of woman could love a dirty fellow like that,\nanyway? And how could even he love her if she were as repulsive as the\nsong described? I moved ahead. Perhaps everyone loved someone; I didn\'t\nknow. I couldn\'t give much thought to love; in order to travel far you had to\nbe detached, and I had the long road back to the campus before me. I strode\nalong, hearing the cartman\'s song become a lonesome, broad-toned whistle\nnow that flowered at the end of each phrase into a tremulous, blue-toned\nchord. And in its flutter and swoop I heard the sound of a railroad train\nhighballing it, lonely across the lonely night. He was the Devil\'s son-in-law,\nall right, and he was a man who could whistle a three-toned chord . . . God\ndamn, I thought, they\'re a hell of a people! And I didn\'t know whether it was\npride or disgust that suddenly flashed over me.\nAt the corner I turned into a drugstore and took a seat at the\ncounter. Several men were bent over plates of food. Glass globes of coffee\nsimmered above blue flames. I could feel the odor of frying bacon reach deep\ninto my stomach as I watched the counterman open the doors of the grill\nand turn the lean strips over and bang the doors shut again. Above, facing\nthe counter, a blonde, sun-burned college girl smiled down, inviting all and\nsundry to drink a coke. The counterman came over.\n"I\'ve got something good for you," he said, placing a glass of water\nbefore me. "How about the special?"\n"What\'s the special?"\n"Pork chops, grits, one egg, hot biscuits and coffee!" He leaned over\nthe counter with a look that seemed to say, There, that ought to excite you,\nboy. Could everyone see that I was southern?\n"I\'ll have orange juice, toast and coffee," I said coldly.\nHe shook his head, "You fooled me," he said, slamming two pieces of\nbread into the toaster. "I would have sworn you were a pork chop man. Is\nthat juice large or small?"\n"Make it large," I said.\nI looked silently at the back of his head as he sliced an orange,\nthinking, I should order the special and get up and walk out. Who does he\nthink he is?\nA seed floated in the thick layer of pulp that formed at the top of\nthe glass. I fished it out with a spoon and then downed the acid drink, proud\nto have resisted the pork chops and grits. It was an act of discipline, a sign\nof the change that was coming over me and which would return me to\ncollege a more experienced man. I would be basically the same, I thought,\nstirring my coffee, yet so subtly changed as to intrigue those who had never\nbeen North. It always helped at the college to be a little different, especially\nif you wished to play a leading role. It made the folks talk about you, try to\nfigure you out. I had to be careful though, not to speak too much like a\nnorthern Negro; they wouldn\'t like that. The thing to do, I thought with a\nsmile, was to give them hints that whatever you did or said was weighted\nwith broad and mysterious meanings that lay just beneath the surface. They\'d\nlove that. And the vaguer you told things, the better. You had to keep them\nguessing -- just as they guessed about Dr. Bledsoe: Did Dr. Bledsoe stop at\nan expensive white hotel when he visited New York? Did he go on parties\nwith the trustees? And how did he act?\n"Man, I bet he has him a fine time. They tell me when Ole Doc gets\nto New York he don\'t stop for the red lights. Say he drinks his good red\nwhiskey and smokes his good black cigars and forgets all about you ole\nknow-nothing-Negroes down here on the campus. Say when he gets up North\nhe makes everybody call him Mister Doctor Bledsoe."\nI smiled as the conversation came back to my mind. I felt good.\nPerhaps it was all to the best that I had been sent away. I had learned more.\nHeretofore all the campus gossip had seemed merely malicious and\ndisrespectful; now I could see the advantage for Dr. Bledsoe. Whether we\nliked him or not, he was never out of our minds. That was a secret of\nleadership. Strange I should think of it now, for although I\'d never given it\nany thought before, I seemed to have known it all along. Only here the\ndistance from the campus seemed to make it clear and hard, and I thought it\nwithout fear. Here it came to hand just as easily as the coin which I now\nplaced on the counter for my breakfast. It was fifteen cents and as I felt for\na nickel I took out another dime, thinking, Is it an insult when one of us\ntips one of them?\nI looked for the counterman, seeing him serving a plate of pork\nchops and grits to a man with a pale blond mustache, and stared; then I\nslapped the dime on the counter and left, annoyed that the dime did not ring\nas loud as a fifty-cent piece.\nWHEN I reached the door of Mr. Emerson\'s office it occurred to me\nthat perhaps I should have waited until the business of the day was under\nway, but I disregarded the idea and went ahead. My being early would be, I\nhoped, an indication of both how badly I wanted work, and how promptly I\nwould perform any assignment given me. Besides, wasn\'t there a saying that\nthe first person of the day to enter a business would get a bargain? Or was\nthat said only of Jewish business? I removed the letter from my brief case.\nWas Emerson a Christian or a Jewish name?\nBeyond the door it was like a museum. I had entered a large\nreception room decorated with cool tropical colors. One wall was almost\ncovered by a huge colored map, from which narrow red silk ribbons stretched\ntautly from each division of the map to a series of ebony pedestals, upon\nwhich sat glass specimen jars containing natural products of the various\ncountries. It was an importing firm. I looked around the room, amazed. There\nwere paintings, bronzes, tapestries, all beautifully arranged. I was dazzled and\nso taken aback that I almost dropped my brief case when I heard a voice\nsay, "And what would your business be?"\nI saw the figure out of a collar ad: ruddy face with blond hair\nfaultlessly in place, a tropical weave suit draped handsomely from his broad\nshoulders, his eyes gray and nervous behind clear-framed glasses.\nI explained my appointment. "Oh, yes," he said. "May I see the\nletter, please?"\nI handed it over, noticing the gold links in the soft white cuffs as he\nextended his hand. Glancing at the envelope he looked back at me with a\nstrange interest in his eyes and said, "Have a seat, please. I\'ll be with you in\na moment."\nI watched him leave noiselessly, moving with a long hip-swinging\nstride that caused me to frown. I went over and took a teakwood chair with\ncushions of emerald-green silk, sitting stiffly with my brief case across my\nknees. He must have been sitting there when I came in, for on a table that\nheld a beautiful dwarf tree I saw smoke rising from a cigarette in a jade ash\ntray. An open book, something called Totem and Taboo, lay beside it. I\nlooked across to a lighted case of Chinese design which held delicate-looking\nstatues of horses and birds, small vases and bowls, each set upon a carved\nwooden base. The room was quiet as a tomb -- until suddenly there was a\nsavage beating of wings and I looked toward the window to see an eruption\nof color, as though a gale had whipped up a bundle of brightly colored rags.\nIt was an aviary of tropical birds set near one of the broad windows, through\nwhich, as the clapping of wings settled down, I could see two ships plying far\nout upon the greenish bay below. A large bird began a song, drawing my\neyes to the throbbing of its bright blue, red and yellow throat. It was\nstartling and I watched the surge and flutter of the birds as their colors\nflared for an instant like an unfurled oriental fan. I wanted to go and stand\nnear the cage for a better view, but decided against it. It might seem\nunbusinesslike. I observed the room from the chair.\nThese folks are the Kings of the Earth! I thought, hearing the bird\nmake an ugly noise. There was nothing like this at the college museum -- or\nanywhere else that I had ever been. I recalled only a few cracked relics from\nslavery times: an iron pot, an ancient bell, a set of ankle-irons and links of\nchain, a primitive loom, a spinning wheel, a gourd for drinking, an ugly\nebony African god that seemed to sneer (presented to the school by some\ntraveling millionaire), a leather whip with copper brads, a branding iron with\nthe double letter MM. Though I had seen them very seldom, they were vivid\nin my mind. They had not been pleasant and whenever I had visited the\nroom I avoided the glass case in which they rested, preferring instead to look\nat photographs of the early days after the Civil War, the times close to those\nblind Barbee had described. And I had not looked even at these too often.\nI tried to relax; the chair was beautiful but hard. Where had the\nman gone? Had he shown any antagonism when he saw me? I was annoyed\nthat I had failed to see him first. One had to watch such details. Suddenly\nthere came a harsh cry from the cage, and once more I saw a mad flashing\nas though the birds had burst into spontaneous flame, fluttering and beating\ntheir wings maliciously against the bamboo bars, only to settle down just as\nsuddenly when the door opened and the blond man stood beckoning, his\nhand upon the knob. I went over, tense inside me. Had I been accepted or\nrejected?\nThere was a question in his eyes. "Come in, please," he said.\n"Thank you," I said, waiting to follow him.\n"Please," he said with a slight smile.\nI moved ahead of him, sounding the tone of his words for a sign.\n"I want to ask you a few questions," he said, waving my letter at two\nchairs.\n"Yes, sir?" I said.\n"Tell me, what is it that you\'re trying to accomplish?" he said.\n"I want a job, sir, so that I can earn enough money to return to\ncollege in the fall."\n"To your old school?"\n"Yes, sir."\n"I see." For a moment he studied me silently. "When do you expect\nto graduate?"\n"Next year, sir. I\'ve completed my junior classes . . ."\n"Oh, you have? That\'s very good. And how old are you?"\n"Almost twenty, sir."\n"A junior at nineteen? You are a good student."\n"Thank you, sir," I said, beginning to enjoy the interview.\n"Were you an athlete?" he asked.\n"No, sir . . ."\n"You have the build," he said, looking me up and down. "You\'d\nprobably make an excellent runner, a sprinter."\n"I\'ve never tried, sir."\n"And I suppose it\'s silly even to ask what you think of your Alma\nMater?" he said.\n"I think it\'s one of the best in the world," I said, hearing my voice\nsurge with deep feeling.\n"I know, I know," he said, with a swift displeasure that surprised me.\nI became alert again as he mumbled something incomprehensible\nabout "nostalgia for Harvard yard."\n"But what if you were offered an opportunity to finish your work at\nsome other college," he said, his eyes widening behind his glasses. His smile\nhad returned.\n"Another college?" I asked, my mind beginning to whirl.\n"Why, yes, say some school in New England . . ."\nI looked at him speechlessly. Did he mean Harvard? Was this good\nor bad. Where was it leading? "I don\'t know, sir," I said cautiously. "I\'ve\nnever thought about it. I\'ve only a year more, and, well, I know everyone at\nmy old school and they know me . . ."\nI came to a confused halt, seeing him look at me with a sigh of\nresignation. What was on his mind? Perhaps I had been too frank about\nreturning to the college, maybe he was against our having a higher education\n. . . But hell, he\'s only a secretary . . . Or is he?\n"I understand," he said calmly. "It was presumptuous of me to even\nsuggest another school. I guess one\'s college is really a kind of mother and\nfather . . . a sacred matter."\n"Yes, sir. That\'s it," I said in hurried agreement.\nHis eyes narrowed. "But now I must ask you an embarrassing\nquestion. Do you mind?"\n"Why, no, sir," I said nervously.\n"I don\'t like to ask this, but it\'s quite necessary . . ." He leaned\nforward with a pained frown. "Tell me, did you read the letter which you\nbrought to Mr. Emerson? This," he said, taking the letter from the table.\n"Why, no, sir! It wasn\'t addressed to me, so naturally I wouldn\'t\nthink of opening it . . ."\n"Of course not, I know you wouldn\'t," he said, fluttering his hand\nand sitting erect. "I\'m sorry and you must dismiss it, like one of those\nannoying personal questions you find so often nowadays on supposedly\nimpersonal forms."\nI didn\'t believe him. "But was it opened, sir? Someone might have\ngone into my things . . ."\n"Oh, no, nothing like that. Please forget the question . . . And tell\nme, please, what are your plans after graduation?"\n"I\'m not sure, sir. I\'d like to be asked to remain at the college as a\nteacher, or as a member of the administrative staff. And . . . Well . . ."\n"Yes? And what else?"\n"Well -- er, I guess I\'d really like to become Dr. Bledsoe\'s assistant .\n. ."\n"Oh, I see," he said, sitting back and forming his mouth into a\nthin-lipped circle. "You\'re very ambitious."\n"I guess I am, sir. But I\'m willing to work hard."\n"Ambition is a wonderful force," he said, "but sometimes it can be\nblinding . . . On the other hand, it can make you successful -- like my father\n. . ." A new edge came into his voice and he frowned and looked down at\nhis hands, which were trembling. "The only trouble with ambition is that it\nsometimes blinds one to realities . . . Tell me, how many of these letters do\nyou have?"\n"I had about seven, sir," I replied, confused by his new turn. "They\'re\n-- "\n"Seven!" He was suddenly angry.\n"Yes, sir, that was all he gave me . . ."\n"And how many of these gentlemen have you succeeded in seeing,\nmay I ask?"\nA sinking feeling came over me. "I haven\'t seen any of them\npersonally, sir."\n"And this is your last letter?"\n"Yes, sir, it is, but I expect to hear from the others . . . They said\n--"\n"Of course you will, and from all seven. They\'re all loyal Americans."\nThere was unmistakable irony in his voice now, and I didn\'t know\nwhat to say.\n"Seven," he repeated mysteriously. "Oh, don\'t let me upset you," he\nsaid with an elegant gesture of self-disgust. "I had a difficult session with my\nanalyst last evening and the slightest thing is apt to set me off. Like an\nalarm clock without control -- Say!" he said, slapping his palm against his\nthighs. "What on earth does that mean?" Suddenly he was in a state. One\nside of his face had begun to twitch and swell.\nI watched him light a cigarette, thinking, What on earth is this all\nabout?\n"Some things are just too unjust for words," he said, expelling a\nplume of smoke, "and too ambiguous for either speech or ideas. By the way,\nhave you ever been to the Club Calamus?"\n"I don\'t think I\'ve ever heard of it, sir," I said.\n"You haven\'t? It\'s very well known. Many of my Harlem friends go\nthere. It\'s a rendezvous for writers, artists and all kinds of celebrities. There\'s\nnothing like it in the city, and by some strange twist it has a truly\ncontinental flavor."\n"I\'ve never been to a night club, sir. I\'ll have to go there to see what\nit\'s like after I\'ve started earning some money," I said, hoping to bring the\nconversation back to the problem of jobs.\nHe looked at me with a jerk of his head, his face beginning to twitch\nagain.\n"I suppose I\'ve been evading the issue again -- as always. Look," he\nburst out impulsively. "Do you believe that two people, two strangers who\nhave never seen one another before can speak with utter frankness and\nsincerity?"\n"Sir?"\n"Oh, damn! What I mean is, do you believe it possible for us, the\ntwo of us, to throw off the mask of custom and manners that insulate man\nfrom man, and converse in naked honesty and frankness?"\n"I don\'t know what you mean exactly, sir." I said.\n"Are you sure?"\n"I . . ."\n"Of course, of course. If I could only speak plainly! I\'m confusing\nyou. Such frankness just isn\'t possible because all our motives are impure.\nForget what I just said. I\'ll try to put it this way -- and remember this,\nplease . . ."\nMy head spun. He was addressing me, leaning forward confidentially,\nas though he\'d known me for years, and I remembered something my\ngrandfather had said long ago: Don\'t let no white man tell you his business,\n\'cause after he tells you he\'s liable to git shame he tole it to you and then\nhe\'ll hate you. Fact is, he was hating you all the time. . .\n". . . I want to try to reveal a part of reality that is most important\nto you -- but I warn you, it\'s going to hurt. No, let me finish," he said,\ntouching my knee lightly and quickly removing his hand as I shifted my\nposition.\n"What I want to do is done very seldom, and, to be honest, it\nwouldn\'t happen now if I hadn\'t sustained a series of impossible frustrations.\nYou see -- well, I\'m thwarted . . . Oh, damn, there I go again, thinking only\nof myself . . . We\'re both frustrated, understand? Both of us, and I want to\nhelp you . . ."\n"You mean you\'ll let me see Mr. Emerson?"\nHe frowned. "Please don\'t seem so happy about it, and don\'t leap to\nconclusions. I want to help, but there is a tyranny involved . . ."\n"A tyranny?" My lungs tightened.\n"Yes. That\'s a way of putting it. Because to help you I must\ndisillusion you . . ."\n"Oh, I don\'t think I mind, sir. Once I see Mr. Emerson, it\'ll be up to\nme. All I want to do is speak to him."\n"Speak to him," he said, getting quickly to his feet and mashing his\ncigarette into the tray with shaking fingers. "No one speaks to him. He does\nthe speaking --" Suddenly he broke off. "On second thought, perhaps you\'d\nbetter leave me your address and I\'ll mail you Mr. Emerson\'s reply in the\nmorning. He\'s really a very busy man."\nHis whole manner had changed.\n"But you said . . ." I stood up, completely confused. Was he having\nfun with me? "Couldn\'t you let me talk to him for just five minutes?" I\npleaded. "I\'m sure I can convince him that I\'m worthy of a job. And if\nthere\'s someone who has tampered with my letter, I\'ll prove my identity . . .\nDr. Bledsoe would --"\n"Identity! My God! Who has any identity any more anyway? It isn\'t\nso perfectly simple. Look," he said with an anguished gesture. "Will you trust\nme?"\n"Why, yes, sir, I trust you."\nHe leaned forward. "Look," he said, his face working violently, "I was\ntrying to tell you that I know many things about you -- not you personally,\nbut fellows like you. Not much, either, but still more than the average. With\nus it\'s still Jim and Huck Finn. A number of my friends are jazz musicians,\nand I\'ve been around. I know the conditions under which you live -- Why go\nback, fellow? There is so much you could do here where there is more\nfreedom. You won\'t find what you\'re looking for when you return anyway;\nbecause so much is involved that you can\'t possibly know. Please don\'t\nmisunderstand me; I don\'t say all this to impress you. Or to give myself\nsome kind of sadistic catharsis. Truly, I don\'t. But I do know this world\nyou\'re trying to contact -- all its virtues and all its unspeakables -- Ha, yes,\nunspeakables. I\'m afraid my father considers me one of the unspeakables . . .\nI\'m Huckleberry, you see . . ."\nHe laughed drily as I tried to make sense of his ramblings.\nHuckleberry? Why did he keep talking about that kid\'s story? I was puzzled\nand annoyed that he could talk to me this way because he stood between me\nand a job, the campus . . .\n"But I only want a job, sir," I said. "I only want to make enough\nmoney to return to my studies."\n"Of course, but surely you suspect there is more to it than that.\nAren\'t you curious about what lies behind the face of things?"\n"Yes, sir, but I\'m mainly interested in a job."\n"Of course," he said, "but life isn\'t that simple . . ."\n"But I\'m not bothered about all the other things, whatever they are,\nsir. They\'re not for me to interfere with and I\'ll be satisfied to go back to\ncollege and remain there as long as they\'ll allow me to."\n"But I want to help you do what is best," he said. "What\'s best,\nmind you. Do you wish to do what\'s best for yourself?"\n"Why, yes, sir. I suppose I do . . ."\n"Then forget about returning to the college. Go somewhere else . . ."\n"You mean leave?"\n"Yes, forget it . . ."\n"But you said that you would help me!"\n"I did and I am --"\n"But what about seeing Mr. Emerson?"\n"Oh, God! Don\'t you see that it\'s best that you do not see him?"\nSuddenly I could not breathe. Then I was standing, gripping my brief\ncase. "What have you got against me?" I blurted. "What did I ever do to\nyou? You never intended to let me see him. Even though I presented my\nletter of introduction. Why? Why? I\'d never endanger your job --"\n"No, no, no! Of course not," he cried, getting to his feet. "You\'ve\nmisunderstood me. You mustn\'t do that! God, there\'s too much\nmisunderstanding. Please don\'t think I\'m trying to prevent you from seeing\nmy -- from seeing Mr. Emerson out of prejudice . . ."\n"Yes, sir, I do," I said angrily. "I was sent here by a friend of his.\nYou read the letter, but still you refuse to let me see him, and now you\'re\ntrying to get me to leave college. What kind of man are you, anyway? What\nhave you got against me? You, a northern white man!"\nHe looked pained. "I\'ve done it badly," he said, "but you must\nbelieve that I am trying to advise you what is best for you." He snatched off\nhis glasses.\n"But I know what\'s best for me," I said. "Or at least Dr. Bledsoe\ndoes, and if I can\'t see Mr. Emerson today, just tell me when I can and I\'ll\nbe here . . ."\nHe bit his lips and shut his eyes, shaking his head from side to side\nas though fighting back a scream. "I\'m sorry, really sorry that I started all of\nthis," he said, suddenly calm. "It was foolish of me to try to advise you, but\nplease, you mustn\'t believe that I\'m against you . . . or your race. I\'m your\nfriend. Some of the finest people I know are Neg -- Well, you see, Mr.\nEmerson is my father."\n"Your father!"\n"My father, yes, though I would have preferred it otherwise. But he\nis, and I could arrange for you to see him. But to be utterly frank, I\'m\nincapable of such cynicism. It would do you no good."\n"But I\'d like to take my chances, Mr. Emerson, sir . . . This is very\nimportant to me. My whole career depends upon it."\n"But you have no chance," he said.\n"But Dr. Bledsoe sent me here," I said, growing more excited. "I\nmust have a chance . . ."\n"Dr. Bledsoe," he said with distaste. "He\'s like my . . . he ought to\nbe horsewhipped! Here," he said, sweeping up the letter and thrusting it\ncrackling toward me. I took it, looking into his eyes that burned back at me.\n"Go on, read it," he cried excitedly. "Go on!"\n"But I wasn\'t asking for this," I said.\n"Read it!"\nMy dear Mr. Emerson:\nThe bearer of this letter is a former student of ours (I say former\nbecause he shall never, under any circumstances, be enrolled as a student\nhere again) who has been expelled for a most serious defection from our\nstrictest rules of deportment.\nDue, however, to circumstances the nature of which I shall explain to\nyou in person on the occasion of the next meeting of the board, it is to the\nbest interests of the college that this young man have no knowledge of the\nfinality of his expulsion. For it is indeed his hope to return here to his\nclasses in the fall. However, it is to the best interests of the great work which\nwe are dedicated to perform, that he continue undisturbed in these vain\nhopes while remaining as far as possible from our midst.\nThis case represents, my dear Mr. Emerson, one of the rare, delicate\ninstances in which one for whom we held great expectations has gone\ngrievously astray, and who in his fall threatens to upset certain delicate\nrelationships between certain interested individuals and the school. Thus,\nwhile the bearer is no longer a member of our scholastic family, it is highly\nimportant that his severance with the college be executed as painlessly as\npossible. I beg of you, sir, to help him continue in the direction of that\npromise which, like the horizon, recedes ever brightly and distantly beyond\nthe hopeful traveler.\nRespectfully, I am your humble servant,\nA. Herbert Bledsoe\nI raised my head. Twenty-five years seemed to have lapsed between\nhis handing me the letter and my grasping its message. I could not believe it,\ntried to read it again. I could not believe it, yet I had a feeling that it all\nhad happened before. I rubbed my eyes, and they felt sandy as though all the\nfluids had suddenly dried.\n"I\'m sorry," he said. "I\'m terribly sorry."\n"What did I do? I always tried to do the right thing\n"That you must tell me," he said. "To what does he refer?"\n"I don\'t know, I don\'t know . . ."\n"But you must have done something."\n"I took a man for a drive, showed him into the Golden Day to help\nhim when he became ill ... I don\'t know\nI told him falteringly of the visit to Trueblood\'s and the trip to the\nGolden Day and of my expulsion, watching his mobile face reflecting his\nreaction to each detail.\n"It\'s little enough," he said when I had finished. "I don\'t understand\nthe man. He is very complicated."\n"I only wanted to return and help," I said.\n"You\'ll never return. You can\'t return now," he said. "Don\'t you see?\nI\'m terribly sorry and yet I\'m glad that I gave in to the impulse to speak to\nyou. Forget it; though that\'s advice which I\'ve been unable to accept myself,\nit\'s still good advice. There is no point in blinding yourself to the truth. Don\'t\nblind yourself . . ."\nI got up, dazed, and started toward the door. He came behind me\ninto the reception room where the birds flamed in the cage, their squawks\nlike screams in a nightmare.\nHe stammered guiltily, "Please, I must ask you never to mention this\nconversation to anyone."\n"No," I said.\n"I wouldn\'t mind, but my father would consider my revelation the\nmost extreme treason . . . You\'re free of him now. I\'m still his prisoner. You\nhave been freed, don\'t you understand? I\'ve still my battle." He seemed near\ntears.\n"I won\'t," I said. "No one would believe me. I can\'t myself. There\nmust be some mistake. There must be . . ."\nI opened the door.\n"Look, fellow," he said. "This evening I\'m having a party at the\nCalamus. Would you like to join my guests? It might help you --"\n"No, thank you, sir. I\'ll be all right."\n"Perhaps you\'d like to be my valet?"\nI looked at him. "No, thank you, sir," I said.\n"Please," he said. "I really want to help. Look, I happen to know of a\npossible job at Liberty Paints. My father has sent several fellows there . . .\nYou should try --"\nI shut the door.\nThe elevator dropped me like a shot and I went out and walked\nalong the street. The sun was very bright now and the people along the walk\nseemed far away. I stopped before a gray wall where high above me the\nheadstones of a church graveyard arose like the tops of buildings. Across the\nstreet in the shade of an awning a shoeshine boy was dancing for pennies. I\nwent on to the corner and got on a bus and went automatically to the rear.\nIn the seat in front of me a dark man in a panama hat kept whistling a tune\nbetween his teeth. My mind, flew in circles, to Bledsoe, Emerson and back\nagain. There was no sense to be made of it. It was a joke. Hell, it couldn\'t\nbe a joke. Yes, it is a joke . . . Suddenly the bus jerked to a stop and I\nheard myself humming the same tune that the man ahead was whistling, and\nthe words came back:\nO well they picked poor Robin clean\nO well they picked poor Robin clean\nWell they tied poor Robin to a stump\nLawd, they picked all the feathers round from Robin\'s rump\nWell they picked poor Robin clean.\nThen I was on my feet, hurrying to the door, hearing the thin,\ntissue-paper-against-the-teeth-of-a-comb whistle following me outside at the\nnext stop. I stood trembling at the curb, watching and half expecting to see\nthe man leap from the door to follow me, whistling the old forgotten jingle\nabout a bare-rumped robin. My mind seized upon the tune. I took the\nsubway and it still droned through my mind after I had reached my room at\nMen\'s House and lay across the bed. What was the\nwho-what-when-why-where of poor old Robin? What had he done and who\nhad tied him and why had they plucked him and why had we sung of his\nfate? It was for a laugh, for a laugh, all the kids had laughed and laughed,\nand the droll tuba player of the old Elk\'s band had rendered it solo on his\nhelical horn; with comical flourishes and doleful phrasing, "Boo boo boo\nbooooo, Poor Robin clean" -- a mock funeral dirge . . . But who was Robin\nand for what had he been hurt and humiliated?\nSuddenly I lay shaking with anger. It was no good. I thought of\nyoung Emerson. What if he\'d lied out of some ulterior motive of his own?\nEveryone seemed to have some plan for me, and beneath that some more\nsecret plan. What was young Emerson\'s plan -- and why should it have\nincluded me? Who was I anyway? I tossed fitfully. Perhaps it was a test of\nmy good will and faith -- But that\'s a lie, I thought. It\'s a lie and you know\nit\'s a lie. I had seen the letter and it had practically ordered me killed. By\nslow degrees . . .\n"My dear Mr. Emerson," I said aloud. "The Robin bearing this letter\nis a former student. Please hope him to death, and keep him running. Your\nmost humble and obedient servant, A. H. Bledsoe . . ."\nSure, that\'s the way it was, I thought, a short, concise verbal coup de\ngrace, straight to the nape of the neck. And Emerson would write in reply?\nSure: "Dear Bled, have met Robin and shaved tail. Signed, Emerson."\nI sat on the bed and laughed. They\'d sent me to the rookery, all\nright. I laughed and felt numb and weak, knowing that soon the pain would\ncome and that no matter what happened to me I\'d never be the same. I felt\nnumb and I was laughing. When I stopped, gasping for breath, I decided that\nI would go back and kill Bledsoe. Yes, I thought, I owe it to the race and to\nmyself. I\'ll kill him.\nAnd the boldness of the idea and the anger behind it made me move\nwith decision. I had to have a job and I took what I hoped was the quickest\nmeans. I called the plant young Emerson had mentioned, and it worked. I\nwas told to report the following morning. It happened so quickly and with\nsuch ease that for a moment I felt turned around. Had they planned it this\nway? But no, they wouldn\'t catch me again. This time I had made the move.\nI could hardly get to sleep for dreaming of revenge.\nChapter 10\nThe plant was in Long Island, and I crossed a bridge in the fog to\nget there and came down in a stream of workers. Ahead of me a huge\nelectric sign announced its message through the drifting strands of fog:\nKEEP AMERICA PURE\nWITH\nLIBERTY PAINTS\nFlags were fluttering in the breeze from each of a maze of buildings\nbelow the sign, and for a moment it was like watching some vast patriotic\nceremony from a distance. But no shots were fired and no bugles sounded. I\nhurried ahead with the others through the fog.\nI was worried, since I had used Emerson\'s name without his\npermission, but when I found my way to the personnel office it worked like\nmagic. I was interviewed by a little droopy-eyed man named Mr. MacDuffy\nand sent to work for a Mr. Kimbro. An office boy came along to direct me.\n"If Kimbro needs him," MacDuffy told the boy, "come back and have\nhis name entered on the shipping department\'s payroll."\n"It\'s tremendous," I said as we left the building. "It looks like a small\ncity."\n"It\'s big all right," he said. "We\'re one of the biggest outfits in the\nbusiness. Make a lot of paint for the government."\nWe entered one of the buildings now and started down a pure white\nhall.\n"You better leave your things in the locker room," he said, opening a\ndoor through which I saw a room with low wooden benches and rows of\ngreen lockers. There were keys in several of the locks, and he selected one\nfor me. "Put your stuff in there and take the key," he said. Dressing, I felt\nnervous. He sprawled with one foot on a bench, watching me closely as he\nchewed on a match stem. Did he suspect that Emerson hadn\'t sent me?\n"They have a new racket around here," he said, twirling the match\nbetween his finger and thumb. There was a note of insinuation in his voice,\nand I looked up from tying my shoe, breathing with conscious evenness.\n"What kind of racket?" I said.\n"Oh, you know. The wise guys firing the regular guys and putting on\nyou colored college boys. Pretty smart," he said. "That way they don\'t have to\npay union wages."\n"How did you know I went to college?" I said.\n"Oh, there\'re about six of you guys out here already. Some up in the\ntesting lab. Everybody knows about that."\n"But I had no idea that was why I was hired," I said.\n"Forget it, Mac," he said. "It\'s not your fault. You new guys don\'t\nknow the score. Just like the union says, it\'s the wise guys in the office.\nThey\'re the ones who make scabs out of you -- Hey! we better hurry."\nWe entered a long, shed-like room in which I saw a series of\noverhead doors along one side and a row of small offices on the other. I\nfollowed the boy down an aisle between endless cans, buckets and drums\nlabeled with the company\'s trademark, a screaming eagle. The paint was\nstacked in neatly pyramided lots along the concrete floor. Then, starting into\none of the offices, the boy stopped short and grinned.\n"Listen to that!"\nSomeone inside the office was swearing violently over a telephone.\n"Who\'s that?" I asked.\nHe grinned. "Your boss, the terrible Mr. Kimbro. We call him\n\'Colonel,\' but don\'t let him catch you."\nI didn\'t like it. The voice was raving about some failure of the\nlaboratory and I felt a swift uneasiness. I didn\'t like the idea of starting to\nwork for a man who was in such a nasty mood. Perhaps he was angry at one\nof the men from the school, and that wouldn\'t make him feel too friendly\ntoward me.\n"Let\'s go in," the boy said. "I\'ve got to get back."\nAs we entered, the man slammed down the phone and picked up\nsome papers.\n"Mr. MacDuffy wants to know if you can use this new man," the boy\nsaid.\n"You damn right I can use him and . . ." the voice trailed off, the\neyes above the stiff military mustache going hard.\n"Well, can you use him?" the boy said. "I got to go make out his\ncard."\n"Okay," the man said finally. "I can use him. I gotta. What\'s his\nname?"\nThe boy read my name off a card.\n"All right," he said, "you go right to work. And you," he said to the\nboy, "get the hell out of here before I give you a chance to earn some of the\nmoney wasted on you every payday!"\n"Aw, gwan, you slave driver," the boy said, dashing from the room.\nReddening, Kimbro turned to me, "Come along, let\'s get going."\nI followed him into the long room where the lots of paint were\nstacked along the floor beneath numbered markers that hung from the ceiling.\nToward the rear I could see two men unloading heavy buckets from a truck,\nstacking them neatly on a low loading platform.\n"Now get this straight," Kimbro said gruffly. "This is a busy\ndepartment and I don\'t have time to repeat things. You have to follow\ninstructions and you\'re going to be doing things you don\'t understand, so get\nyour orders the first time and get them right! I won\'t have time to stop and\nexplain everything. You have to catch on by doing exactly what I tell you.\nYou got that?"\nI nodded, noting that his voice became louder when the men across\nthe floor stopped to listen.\n"All right," he said, picking up several tools. "Now come over here."\n"He\'s Kimbro," one of the men said.\nI watched him kneel and open one of the buckets, stirring a milky\nbrown substance. A nauseating stench arose. I wanted to step away. But he\nstirred it vigorously until it became glossy white, holding the spatula like a\ndelicate instrument and studying the paint as it laced off the blade, back into\nthe bucket. Kimbro frowned.\n"Damn those laboratory blubberheads to hell! There\'s got to be dope\nput in every single sonofabitching bucket. And that\'s what you\'re going to do,\nand it\'s got to be put in so it can be trucked out of here before 11:30." He\nhanded me a white enamel graduate and what looked like a battery\nhydrometer.\n"The idea is to open each bucket and put in ten drops of this stuff,"\nhe said. "Then you stir it \'til it disappears. After it\'s mixed you take this\nbrush and paint out a sample on one of these." He produced a number of\nsmall rectangular boards and a small brush from his jacket pocket. "You\nunderstand?"\n"Yes, sir." But when I looked into the white graduate I hesitated; the\nliquid inside was dead black. Was he trying to kid me?\n"What\'s wrong?"\n"I don\'t know, sir . . . I mean. Well, I don\'t want to start by asking\na lot of stupid questions, but do you know what\'s in this graduate?"\nHis eyes snapped. "You damn right I know," he said. "You just do\nwhat you\'re told!"\n"I just wanted to make sure, sir," I said.\n"Look," he said, drawing in his breath with an exaggerated show of\npatience. "Take the dropper and fill it full . . . Go on, do it!"\nI filled it.\n"Now measure ten drops into the paint . . . There, that\'s it, not too\ngoddam fast. Now. You want no more than ten, and no less."\nSlowly, I measured the glistening black drops, seeing them settle\nupon the surface and become blacker still, spreading suddenly out to the\nedges.\n"That\'s it. That\'s all you have to do," he said. "Never mind how it\nlooks. That\'s my worry. You just do what you\'re told and don\'t try to think\nabout it. When you\'ve done five or six buckets, come back and see if the\nsamples are dry . . . And hurry, we\'ve got to get this batch back off to\nWashington by 11:30 . . ."\nI worked fast but carefully. With a man like this Kimbro the least\nthing done incorrectly would cause trouble. So I wasn\'t supposed to think! To\nhell with him. Just a flunkey, a northern redneck, a Yankee cracker! I mixed\nthe paint thoroughly, then brushed it smoothly on one of the pieces of board,\ncareful that the brush strokes were uniform.\nStruggling to remove an especially difficult cover, I wondered if the\nsame Liberty paint was used on the campus, or if this "Optic White" was\nsomething made exclusively for the government. Perhaps it was of a better\nquality, a special mix. And in my mind I could see the brightly trimmed and\nfreshly decorated campus buildings as they appeared on spring mornings --\nafter the fall painting and the light winter snows, with a cloud riding over\nand a darting bird above -- framed by the trees and encircling vines. The\nbuildings had always seemed more impressive because they were the only\nbuildings to receive regular paintings; usually, the nearby houses and cabins\nwere left untouched to become the dull grained gray of weathered wood. And\nI remembered how the splinters in some of the boards were raised from the\ngrain by the wind, the sun and the rain until the clapboards shone with a\nsatiny, silvery, silver-fish sheen. Like Trueblood\'s cabin, or the Golden Day . .\n. The Golden Day had once been painted white; now its paint was flaking\naway with the years, the scratch of a finger being enough to send it\nshowering down. Damn that Golden Day! But it was strange how life\nconnected up; because I had carried Mr. Norton to the old rundown building\nwith rotting paint, I was here. If, I thought, one could slow down his\nheartbeats and memory to the tempo of the black drops falling so slowly into\nthe bucket yet reacting so swiftly, it would seem like a sequence in a feverish\ndream . . . I was so deep in reverie that I failed to hear Kimbro approach.\n"How\'s it coming?" he said, standing with hands on hips.\n"All right, sir."\n"Let\'s see," he said, selecting a sample and running his thumb across\nthe board. "That\'s it, as white as George Washington\'s Sunday-go-to-meetin\'\nwig and as sound as the all-mighty dollar! That\'s paint!" he said proudly.\n"That\'s paint that\'ll cover just about anything!"\nHe looked as though I had expressed a doubt and I hurried to say,\n"It\'s certainly white all right."\n"White! It\'s the purest white that can be found. Nobody makes a\npaint any whiter. This batch right here is heading for a national monument!"\n"I see," I said, quite impressed.\nHe looked at his watch. "Just keep it up," he said. "If I don\'t hurry\nI\'ll be late for that production conference! Say, you\'re nearly out of dope:\nyou\'d better go in the tank room and refill it . . . And don\'t waste any time!\nI\'ve got to go."\nHe shot away without telling me where the tank room was. It was\neasy to find, but I wasn\'t prepared for so many tanks. There were seven;\neach with a puzzling code stenciled on it. It\'s just like Kimbro not to tell me,\nI thought. You can\'t trust any of them. Well, it doesn\'t matter, I\'ll pick the\ntank from the contents of the drip cans hanging from the spigots.\nBut while the first five tanks contained clear liquids that smelled like\nturpentine, the last two both contained something black like the dope, but\nwith different codes. So I had to make a choice. Selecting the tank with the\ndrip can that smelled most like the dope, I filled the graduate, congratulating\nmyself for not having to waste time until Kimbro returned.\nThe work went faster now, the mixing easier. The pigment and heavy\noils came free of the bottom much quicker, and when Kimbro returned I was\ngoing at top speed. "How many have you finished?" he asked.\n"About seventy-five, I think, sir. I lost count."\n"That\'s pretty good, but not fast enough. They\'ve been putting\npressure on me to get the stuff out. Here, I\'ll give you a hand."\nThey must have given him hell, I thought, as he got grunting to his\nknees and began removing covers from the buckets. But he had hardly started\nwhen he was called away.\nWhen he left I took a look at the last bunch of samples and got a\nshock: Instead of the smooth, hard surface of the first, they were covered\nwith a sticky goo through which I could see the grain of the wood. What on\nearth had happened? The paint was not as white and glossy as before; it had\na gray tinge. I stirred it vigorously, then grabbed a rag, wiping each of the\nboards clean, then made a new sample of each bucket. I grew panicky lest\nKimbro return before I finished. Working feverishly, I made it, but since the\npaint required a few minutes to dry I picked up two finished buckets and\nstarted lugging them over to the loading platform. I dropped them with a\nthump as the voice rang out behind me. It was Kimbro.\n"What the hell!" he yelled, smearing his finger over one of the\nsamples. "This stuff\'s still wet!"\nI didn\'t know what to say. He snatched up several of the later\nsamples, smearing them, and letting out a groan. "Of all the things to happen\nto me. First they take all my good men and then they send me you. What\'d\nyou do to it?"\n"Nothing, sir. I followed your directions," I said defensively.\nI watched him peer into the graduate, lifting the dropper and sniffing\nit, his face glowing with exasperation.\n"Who the hell gave you this?"\n"No one . . ."\n"Then where\'d you get it?"\n"From the tank room."\nSuddenly he dashed for the tank room, sloshing the liquid as he ran.\nI thought, Oh, hell, and before I could follow, he burst out of the door in a\nfrenzy.\n"You took the wrong tank," he shouted. "What the hell, you trying to\nsabotage the company? That stuff wouldn\'t work in a million years. It\'s\nremover, concentrated remover! Don\'t you know the difference?"\n"No, sir, I don\'t. It looked the same to me. I didn\'t know what I was\nusing and you didn\'t tell me. I was trying to save time and took what I\nthought was right."\n"But why this one?"\n"Because it smelled the same --" I began.\n"Smelted!" he roared. "Goddamit, don\'t you know you can\'t smell shit\naround all those fumes? Come on to my office!"\nI was torn between protesting and pleading for fairness. It was not\nall my fault and I didn\'t want the blame, but I did wish to finish out the\nday. Throbbing with anger I followed, listening as he called personnel.\n"Hello? Mac? Mac, this is Kimbro. It\'s about this fellow you sent me\nthis morning. I\'m sending him in to pick up his pay . . . What did he do?\nHe doesn\'t satisfy me, that\'s what. I don\'t like his work . . . So the old man\nhas to have a report, so what? Make him one. Tell him goddamit this fellow\nruined a batch of government stuff -- Hey! No, don\'t tell him that . . .\nListen, Mac, you got anyone else out there? . . . Okay, forget it."\nHe crashed down the phone and swung toward me. "I swear I don\'t\nknow why they hire you fellows. You just don\'t belong in a paint plant. Come\non."\nBewildered, I followed him into the tank room, yearning to quit and\ntell him to go to hell. But I needed the money, and even though this was the\nNorth I wasn\'t ready to fight unless I had to. Here I\'d be one against how\nmany?\nI watched him empty the graduate back into the tank and noted\ncarefully when he went to another marked SKA-3-69-T-Y and refilled it. Next\ntime I would know.\n"Now, for God\'s sake," he said, handing me the graduate, "be careful\nand try to do the job right. And if you don\'t know what to do, ask\nsomebody. I\'ll be in my office."\nI returned to the buckets, my emotions whirling. Kimbro had\nforgotten to say what was to be done with the spoiled paint. Seeing it there I\nwas suddenly seized by an angry impulse, and, filling the dropper with fresh\ndope, I stirred ten drops into each bucket and pressed home the covers. Let\nthe government worry about that, I thought, and started to work on the\nunopened buckets. I stirred until my arm ached and painted the samples as\nsmoothly as I could, becoming more skillful as I went along.\nWhen Kimbro came down the floor and watched I glanced up silently\nand continued stirring.\n"How is it?" he said, frowning.\n"I don\'t know," I said, picking up a sample and hesitating.\n"Well?"\n"It\'s nothing . . . a speck of dirt," I said, standing and holding out\nthe sample, a tightness growing within me.\nHolding it close to his face, he ran his fingers over the surface and\nsquinted at the texture. "That\'s more like it," he said. "That\'s the way it\noughta be."\nI watched with a sense of unbelief as he rubbed his thumb over the\nsample, handed it back and left without a further word.\nI looked at the painted slab. It appeared the same: a gray tinge\nglowed through the whiteness, and Kimbro had failed to detect it. I stared for\nabout a minute, wondering if I were seeing things, inspected another and\nanother. All were the same, a brilliant white diffused with gray, I closed my\neyes for a moment and looked again and still no change. Well, I thought, as\nlong as he\'s satisfied . . .\nBut I had a feeling that something had gone wrong, something far\nmore important than the paint; that either I had played a trick on Kimbro or\nhe, like the trustees and Bledsoe, was playing one on me . . .\nWhen the truck backed up to the platform I was pressing the cover\non the last bucket -- and there stood Kimbro above me.\n"Let\'s see your samples," he said.\nI reached, trying to select the whitest, as the blue-shirted truckmen\nclimbed through the loading door.\n"How about it, Kimbro," one of them said, "can we get started?"\n"Just a minute, now," he said, studying the sample, "just a minute . .\n."\nI watched him nervously, waiting for him to throw a fit over the gray\ntinge and hating myself for feeling nervous and afraid. What would I say?\nBut now he was turning to the truckmen.\n"All right, boys, get the hell out of here.\n"And you," he said to me, "go see MacDuffy; you\'re through."\nI stood there, staring at the back of his head, at the pink neck\nbeneath the cloth cap and the iron-gray hair. So he\'d let me stay only to\nfinish the mixing. I turned away, there was nothing that I could do. I cursed\nhim all the way to the personnel office. Should I write the owners about\nwhat had happened? Perhaps they didn\'t know that Kimbro was having so\nmuch to do with the quality of the paint. But upon reaching the office I\nchanged my mind. Perhaps that is how things are done here, I thought,\nperhaps the real quality of the paint is always determined by the man who\nships it rather than by those who mix it. To hell with the whole thing . . .\nI\'ll find another job.\nBut I wasn\'t fired. MacDuffy sent me to the basement of Building\nNo. 2 on a new assignment.\n"When you get down there just tell Brockway that Mr. Sparland\ninsists that he have an assistant. You do whatever he tells you."\n"What is that name again, sir?" I said.\n"Lucius Brockway," he said. "He\'s in charge."\nIT WAS a deep basement. Three levels underground I pushed upon a\nheavy metal door marked "Danger" and descended into a noisy, dimly lit\nroom. There was something familiar about the fumes that filled the air and I\nhad just thought pine, when a high-pitched Negro voice rang out above the\nmachine sounds.\n"Who you looking for down here?"\n"I\'m looking for the man in charge," I called, straining to locate the\nvoice.\n"You talkin\' to him. What you want?"\nThe man who moved out of the shadow and looked at me sullenly\nwas small, wiry and very natty in his dirty overalls. And as I approached him\nI saw his drawn face and the cottony white hair showing beneath his tight,\nstriped engineer\'s cap. His manner puzzled me. I couldn\'t tell whether he felt\nguilty about something himself, or thought I had committed some crime. I\ncame closer, staring. He was barely five feet tall, his overalls looking now as\nthough he had been dipped in pitch.\n"All right," he said. "I\'m a busy man. What you want?"\n"I\'m looking for Lucius," I said.\nHe frowned. "That\'s me -- and don\'t come calling me by my first\nname. To you and all like you I\'m Mister Brockway . . ."\n"You . . . ?" I began.\n"Yeah, me! Who sent you down here anyway?"\n"The personnel office," I said. "I was told to tell you that Mr.\nSparland said for you to be given an assistant."\n"Assistant!" he said. "I don\'t need no damn assistant! Old Man\nSparland must think I\'m getting old as him. Here I been running things by\nmyself all these years and now they keep trying to send me some assistant.\nYou get on back up there and tell \'em that when I want an assistant I\'ll ask\nfor one!"\nI was so disgusted to find such a man in charge that I turned\nwithout a word and started back up the stairs. First Kimbro, I thought, and\nnow this old . . .\n"Hey! wait a minute!"\nI turned, seeing him beckon.\n"Come on back here a minute," he called, his voice cutting sharply\nthrough the roar of the furnaces.\nI went back, seeing him remove a white cloth from his hip pocket\nand wipe the glass face of a pressure gauge, then bend close to squint at the\nposition of the needle.\n"Here," he said, straightening and handing me the cloth, "you can\nstay \'til I can get in touch with the Old Man. These here have to be kept\nclean so\'s I can see how much pressure I\'m getting."\nI took the cloth without a word and began rubbing the glasses. He\nwatched me critically.\n"What\'s your name?" he said.\nI told him, shouting it in the roar of the furnaces.\n"Wait a minute," he called, going over and turning a valve in an\nintricate network of pipes. I heard the noise rise to a higher, almost\nhysterical pitch, somehow making it possible to hear without yelling, our\nvoices moving blurrily underneath.\nReturning, he looked at me sharply, his withered face an animated\nblack walnut with shrewd, reddish eyes.\n"This here\'s the first time they ever sent me anybody like you," he\nsaid as though puzzled. "That\'s how come I called you back. Usually they\nsends down some young white fellow who thinks he\'s going to watch me a\nfew days and ask me a heap of questions and then take over. Some folks is\ntoo damn simple to even talk about," he said, grimacing and waving his hand\nin a violent gesture of dismissal. "You an engineer?" he said, looking quickly\nat me.\n"An engineer?"\n"Yeah, that\'s what I asked you," he said challengingly.\n"Why, no, sir, I\'m no engineer."\n"You sho?"\n"Of course I\'m sure. Why shouldn\'t I be?"\nHe seemed to relax. "That\'s all right then. I have to watch them\npersonnel fellows. One of them thinks he\'s going to git me out of here, when\nhe ought to know by now he\'s wasting his time. Lucius Brockway not only\nintends to protect hisself, he knows how to do it! Everybody knows I been\nhere ever since there\'s been a here -- even helped dig the first foundation.\nThe Old Man hired me, nobody else; and, by God, it\'ll take the Old Man to\nfire me!"\nI rubbed away at the gauges, wondering what had brought on this\noutburst, and was somewhat relieved that he seemed to hold nothing against\nme personally.\n"Where you go to school?" he said.\nI told him.\n"Is that so? What you learning down there?"\n"Just general subjects, a regular college course," I said.\n"Mechanics?"\n"Oh no, nothing like that, just a liberal arts course. No trades."\n"Is that so?" he said doubtfully. Then suddenly, "How much pressure\nI got on that gauge right there?"\n"Which?"\n"You see it," he pointed. "That one right there!"\nI looked, calling off, "Forty-three and two-tenths pounds."\n"Uh huh, uh huh, that\'s right." He squinted at the gauge and back at\nme. "Where you learn to read a gauge so good?"\n"In my high-school physics class. It\'s like reading a clock."\n"They teach you that in high school?"\n"That\'s right."\n"Well, that\'s going to be one of your jobs. These here gauges have to\nbe checked every fifteen minutes. You ought to be able to do that."\n"I think I can," I said.\n"Some kin, some caint. By the way, who hired you?"\n"Mr. MacDuffy," I said, wondering why all the questions.\n"Yeah, then where you been all morning?"\n"I was working over in Building No. 1."\n"That there\'s a heap of building. Where \'bouts?"\n"For Mr. Kimbro."\n"I see, I see. I knowed they oughtn\'t to be hiring anybody this late\nin the day. What Kimbro have you doing?"\n"Putting dope in some paint that went bad," I said wearily, annoyed\nwith all the questions.\nHis lips shot out belligerently. "What paint went bad?"\n"I think it was some for the government . . ."\nHe cocked his head. "I wonder how come nobody said nothing to me\nabout it," he said thoughtfully. "Was it in buckets or them little biddy cans?"\n"Buckets."\n"Oh, that ain\'t so bad, them little ones is a heap of work." He gave\nme a high dry laugh. "How you hear about this job?" he snapped suddenly,\nas though trying to catch me off guard.\n"Look," I said slowly, "a man I know told me about the job;\nMacDuffy hired me; I worked this morning for Mr. Kimbro; and I was sent\nto you by Mr. MacDuffy."\nHis face tightened. "You friends to one of those colored fellows?"\n"Who?"\n"Up in the lab?"\n"No," I said. "Anything else you want to know?"\nHe gave me a long, suspicious look and spat upon a hot pipe,\ncausing it to steam furiously. I watched him remove a heavy engineer\'s watch\nfrom his breast pocket and squint at the dial importantly, then turn to check\nit with an electric clock that glowed from the wall. "You keep on wiping them\ngauges," he said. "I got to look at my soup. And look here." He pointed to\none of the gauges. "I wants you to keep a \'specially sharp eye on this here\nsonofabitch. The last couple of days he\'s \'veloped a habit of building up too\nfast. Causes me a heap of trouble. You see him gitting past 75, you yell, and\nyell loud!"\nHe went back into the shadows and I saw a shaft of brightness mark\nthe opening of a door.\nRunning the rag over a gauge I wondered how an apparently\nuneducated old man could gain such a responsible job. He certainly didn\'t\nsound like an engineer; yet he alone was on duty. And you could never be\nsure, for at home an old man employed as a janitor at the Water Works was\nthe only one who knew the location of all of the water mains. He had been\nemployed at the beginning, before any records were kept, and actually\nfunctioned as an engineer though he drew a janitor\'s pay. Perhaps this old\nBrockway was protecting himself from something. After all, there was\nantagonism to our being employed. Maybe he was dissimulating, like some of\nthe teachers at the college, who, to avoid trouble when driving through the\nsmall surrounding towns, wore chauffeur caps and pretended that their cars\nbelonged to white men. But why was he pretending with me? And what was\nhis job?\nI looked around me. It was not just an engine room; I knew, for I\nhad been in several, the last at college. It was something more. For one\nthing, the furnaces were made differently and the flames that flared through\nthe cracks of the fire chambers were too intense and too blue. And there\nwere the odors. No, he was making something down here, something that had\nto do with paint, and probably something too filthy and dangerous for white\nmen to be willing to do even for money. It was not paint because I had been\ntold that the paint was made on the floors above, where, passing through, I\nhad seen men in splattered aprons working over large vats filled with whirling\npigment. One thing was certain: I had to be careful with this crazy Brockway;\nhe didn\'t like my being here . . . And there he was, entering the room now\nfrom the stairs.\n"How\'s it going?" he asked.\n"All right," I said. "Only it seems to have gotten louder."\n"Oh, it gets pretty loud down here, all right; this here\'s the uproar\ndepartment and I\'m in charge . . . Did she go over the mark?"\n"No, it\'s holding steady," I said.\n"That\'s good. I been having plenty trouble with it lately. Haveta bust\nit down and give it a good going over soon as I can get the tank clear."\nPerhaps he is the engineer, I thought, watching him inspect the\ngauges and go to another part of the room to adjust a series of valves. Then\nhe went and said a few words into a wall phone and called me, pointing to\nthe valves.\n"I\'m fixing to shoot it to \'em upstairs," he said gravely. "When I give\nyou the signal I want you to turn \'em wide open. \'N when I give you the\nsecond signal I want you to close \'em up again. Start with this here red one\nand work right straight across . . ."\nI took my position and waited, as he took a stand near the gauge.\n"Let her go," he called. I opened the valves, hearing the sound of\nliquids rushing through the huge pipes. At the sound of a buzzer I looked up\n. . .\n"Start closing," he yelled. "What you looking at? Close them valves!\n"What\'s wrong with you?" he asked when the last valve was closed.\n"I expected you to call."\n"I said I\'d signal you. Caint you tell the difference between a signal\nand a call? Hell, I buzzed you. You don\'t want to do that no more. When I\nbuzz you I want you to do something and do it quick!"\n"You\'re the boss," I said sarcastically.\n"You mighty right, I\'m the boss, and don\'t forgit it. Now come on\nback here, we got work to do."\nWe came to a strange-looking machine consisting of a huge set of\ngears connecting a series of drum-like rollers. Brockway took a shovel and\nscooped up a load of brown crystals from a pile on the floor, pitching them\nskillfully into a receptacle on top of the machine.\n"Grab a scoop and let\'s git going," he ordered briskly. "You ever done\nthis before?" he asked as I scooped into the pile.\n"It\'s been a long time," I said. "What is this material?"\nHe stopped shoveling and gave me a long, black stare, then returned\nto the pile, his scoop ringing on the floor. You\'ll have to remember not to\nask this suspicious old bastard any questions, I thought, scooping into the\nbrown pile.\nSoon I was perspiring freely. My hands were sore and I began to\ntire. Brockway watched me out of the corner of his eye, snickering noiselessly.\n"You don\'t want to overwork yourself, young feller," he said blandly.\n"I\'ll get used to it," I said, scooping up a heavy load.\n"Oh, sho, sho," he said. "Sho. But you better take a rest when you\ngit tired."\nI didn\'t stop. I piled on the material until he said, "That there\'s the\nscoop we been trying to find. That\'s what we want. You better stand back a\nlittle, \'cause I\'m fixing to start her up."\nI backed away, watching him go over and push a switch. Shuddering\ninto motion, the machine gave a sudden scream like a circular saw, and sent\na tattoo of sharp crystals against my face. I moved clumsily away, seeing\nBrockway grin like a dried prune. Then with the dying hum of the furiously\nwhirling drums, I heard the grains sifting lazily in the sudden stillness, sliding\nsand-like down the chute into the pot underneath.\nI watched him go over and open a valve. A sharp new smell of oil\narose.\n"Now she\'s all set to cook down; all we got to do is put the fire to\nher," he said, pressing a button on something that looked like the burner of\nan oil furnace. There was an angry hum, followed by a slight explosion that\ncaused something to rattle, and I could hear a low roaring begin.\n"Know what that\'s going to be when it\'s cooked?"\n"No, sir," I said. .\n"Well that\'s going to be the guts, what they call the vee-hicle of the\npaint. Least it will be by time I git through putting other stuff with it."\n"But I thought the paint was made upstairs . . ."\n"Naw, they just mixes in the color, make it look pretty. Right down\nhere is where the real paint is made. Without what I do they couldn\'t do\nnothing, they be making bricks without straw. An\' not only do I make up the\nbase, I fixes the varnishes and lots of the oils too . . ."\n"So that\'s it," I said. "I was wondering what you did down here."\n"A whole lots of folks wonders about that without gitting anywhere.\nBut as I was saying, caint a single doggone drop of paint move out of the\nfactory lessen it comes through Lucius Brockway\'s hands."\n"How long have you been doing this?"\n"Long enough to know what I\'m doing," he said. "And I learned it\nwithout all that education that them what\'s been sent down here is suppose\nto have. I learned it by doing it. Them personnel fellows don\'t want to face\nthe facts, but Liberty Paints wouldn\'t be worth a plugged nickel if they didn\'t\nhave me here to see that it got a good strong base. Old Man Sparland know\nit though. I caint stop laughing over the time when I was down with a touch\nof pneumonia and they put one of them so-called engineers to pooling around\ndown here. Why, they started to having so much paint go bad they didn\'t\nknow what to do. Paint was bleeding and wrinkling, wouldn\'t cover or\nnothing -- you know, a man could make hisself all kinds of money if he\nfound out what makes paint bleed. Anyway, everything was going bad. Then\nword got to me that they done put that fellow in my place and when I got\nwell I wouldn\'t come back. Here I been with \'em so long and loyal and\neverything. Shucks, I just sent \'em word that Lucius Brockway was retiring!\n"Next thing you know here come the Old Man. He so old hisself his\nchauffeur has to help him up them steep stairs at my place. Come in\na-puffing and a-blowing, says, \'Lucius, what\'s this I hear \'bout you retiring?\'\n" \'Well, sir, Mr. Sparland, sir,\' I says, \'I been pretty sick, as you well\nknow, and I\'m gitting kinder along in my years, as you well know, and I\nhear that this here Italian fellow you got in my place is doing so good I\nthought I\'d might as well take it easy round the house.\'\n"Why, you\'d a-thought I\'d done cursed him or something. \'What kind\nof talk is that from you, Lucius Brockway,\' he said, \'taking it easy round the\nhouse when we need you out to the plant? Don\'t you know the quickest way\nto die is to retire? Why, that fellow out at the plant don\'t know a thing\nabout those furnaces. I\'m so worried about what he\'s going to do, that he\'s\nliable to blow up the plant or something that I took out some extra\ninsurance. He can\'t do your job,\' he said. \'He don\'t have the touch. We\nhaven\'t put out a first-class batch of paint since you been gone.\' Now that\nwas the Old Man hisself!" Lucius Brockway said.\n"So what happened?" I said.\n"What you mean, what happened?" he said, looking as though it were\nthe most unreasonable question in the world. "Shucks, a few days later the\nOld Man had me back down here in full control. That engineer got so mad\nwhen he found out he had to take orders from me he quit the next day."\nHe spat on the floor and laughed. "Heh, heh, heh, he was a fool,\nthat\'s what. A fool! He wanted to boss me and I know more about this\nbasement than anybody, boilers and everything. I helped lay the pipes and\neverything, and what I mean is I knows the location of each and every pipe\nand switch and cable and wire and everything else -- both in the floors and\nin the walls and out in the yard. Yes, sir! And what\'s more, I got it in my\nhead so good I can trace it out on paper down to the last nut and bolt; and\nain\'t never been to nobody\'s engineering school neither, ain\'t even passed by\none, as far as I know. Now what you think about that?"\n"I think it\'s remarkable," I said, thinking, I don\'t like this old man.\n"Oh, I wouldn\'t call it that," he said. "It\'s just that I been round here\nso long. I been studying this machinery for over twenty-five years. Sho, and\nthat fellow thinking \'cause he been to some school and learned how to read a\nblueprint and how to fire a boiler he knows more \'bout this plant than\nLucius Brockway. That fool couldn\'t make no engineer \'cause he can\'t see\nwhat\'s staring him straight in the face . . . Say, you forgittin\' to watch them\ngauges."\nI hurried over, finding all the needles steady.\n"They\'re okay," I called.\n"All right, but I\'m warning you to keep an eye on \'em. You caint\nforgit down here, \'cause if you do, you liable to blow up something. They got\nall this machinery, but that ain\'t everything; we are the machines inside the\nmachine.\n"You know the best selling paint we got, the one that made this here\nbusiness?" he asked as I helped him fill a vat with a smelly substance.\n"No, I don\'t."\n"Our white, Optic White."\n"Why the white rather than the others?"\n" \'Cause we started stressing it from the first. We make the best\nwhite paint in the world, I don\'t give a damn what nobody says. Our white is\nso white you can paint a chunka coal and you\'d have to crack it open with a\nsledge hammer to prove it wasn\'t white clear through!"\nHis eyes glinted with humorless conviction and I had to drop my\nhead to hide my grin.\n"You notice that sign on top of the building?"\n"Oh, you can\'t miss that," I said.\n"You read the slogan?"\n"I don\'t remember, I was in such a hurry."\n"Well, you might not believe it, but I helped the Old Man make up\nthat slogan. \'If It\'s Optic White, It\'s the Right White,\' " he quoted with an\nupraised finger, like a preacher quoting holy writ. "I got me a\nthree-hundred-dollar bonus for helping to think that up. These newfangled\nadvertising folks is been tryin\' to work up something about the other colors,\ntalking about rainbows or something, but hell, they caint get nowhere."\n" \'If It\'s Optic White, It\'s the Right White,\'" I repeated and suddenly\nhad to repress a laugh as a childhood jingle rang through my mind:\n" \'If you\'re white, you\'re right,\' " I said.\n"That\'s it," he said. "And that\'s another reason why the Old Man\nain\'t goin\' to let nobody come down here messing with me. He knows what a\nlot of them new fellers don\'t; he knows that the reason our paint is so good\nis because of the way Lucius Brockway puts the pressure on them oils and\nresins before they even leaves the tanks." He laughed maliciously. "They\nthinks \'cause everything down here is done by machinery, that\'s all there is to\nit. They crazy! Ain\'t a continental thing that happens down here that ain\'t as\niffen I done put my black hands into it! Them machines just do the cooking,\nthese here hands right here do the sweeting. Yes, sir! Lucius Brockway hit it\nsquare on the head! I dips my fingers in and sweets it! Come on, let\'s eat . .\n."\n"But what about the gauges?" I said, seeing him go over and take a\nthermos bottle from a shelf near one of the furnaces.\n"Oh, we\'ll be here close enough to keep an eye on \'em. Don\'t you\nworry \'bout that."\n"But I left my lunch in the locker room over at Building No. 1."\n"Go on and git it and come back here and eat. Down here we have\nto always be on the job. A man don\'t need no more\'n fifteen minutes to eat\nno-how; then I say let him git on back on the job."\nUpON opening the door I thought I had made a mistake. Men\ndressed in splattered painters\' caps and overalls sat about on benches,\nlistening to a thin tubercular-looking man who was addressing them in a\nnasal voice. Everyone looked at me and I was starting out when the thin man\ncalled, "There\'s plenty of seats for late comers. Come in, brother . . ."\nBrother? Even after my weeks in the North this was surprising. "I\nwas looking for the locker room," I spluttered.\n"You\'re in it, brother. Weren\'t you told about the meeting?"\n"Meeting? Why, no, sir, I wasn\'t."\nThe chairman frowned. "You see, the bosses are not co-operating," he\nsaid to the others. "Brother, who\'s your foreman?"\n"Mr. Brockway, sir," I said.\nSuddenly the men began scraping their feet and cursing. I looked\nabout me. What was wrong? Were they objecting to my referring to Brockway\nas Mister?\n"Quiet, brothers," the chairman said, leaning across his table, his\nhand cupped to his ear. "Now what was that, brother; who is your foreman?"\n"Lucius Brockway, sir," I said, dropping the Mister.\nBut this seemed only to make them more hostile. "Get him the hell\nout of here," they shouted. I turned. A group on the far side of the room\nkicked over a bench, yelling, "Throw him out! Throw him out!"\nI inched backwards, hearing the little man bang on the table for\norder. "Men, brothers! Give the brother a chance . . ."\n"He looks like a dirty fink to me. A first-class enameled fink!"\nThe hoarsely voiced word grated my ears like "nigger" in an angry\nsouthern mouth . . .\n"Brothers, please!" The chairman was waving his hands as I reached\nout behind me for the door and touched an arm, feeling it snatch violently\naway. I dropped my hand.\n"Who sent this fink into the meeting, brother chairman? Ask him\nthat!" a man demanded.\n"No, wait," the chairman said. "Don\'t ride that word too hard . . ."\n"Ask him, brother chairman!" another man said.\n"Okay, but don\'t label a man a fink until you know for sure." The\nchairman turned to me. "How\'d you happen in here, brother?"\nThe men quieted, listening.\n"I left my lunch in my locker," I said, my mouth dry.\n"You weren\'t sent into the meeting?"\n"No, sir, I didn\'t know about any meeting."\n"The hell he says. None of these finks ever knows!"\n"Throw the lousy bastard out!"\n"Now, wait," I said.\nThey became louder, threatening.\n"Respect the chair!" the chairman shouted. "We\'re a democratic union\nhere, following democratic --"\n"Never mind, git rid of the fink!"\n". . . procedures. It\'s our task to make friends with all the workers.\nAnd I mean all. That\'s how we build the union strong. Now let\'s hear what\nthe brother\'s got to say. No more of that beefing and interrupting!"\nI broke into a cold sweat, my eyes seeming to have become\nextremely sharp, causing each face to stand out vivid in its hostility.\nI heard, "When were you hired, friend?"\n"This morning," I said.\n"See, brothers, he\'s a new man. We don\'t want to make the mistake\nof judging the worker by his foreman. Some of you also work for\nsonsabitches, remember?"\nSuddenly the men began to laugh and curse. "Here\'s one right here,"\none of them yelled.\n"Mine wants to marry the boss\'s daughter -- a frigging eight-day\nwonder!"\nThis sudden change made me puzzled and angry, as though they\nwere making me the butt of a joke.\n"Order, brothers! Perhaps the brother would like to join the union.\nHow about it, brother?"\n"Sir . . . ?" I didn\'t know what to say. I knew very little about\nunions -- but most of these men seemed hostile . . . And before I could\nanswer a fat man with shaggy gray hair leaped to his feet, shouting angrily,\n"I\'m against it! Brothers, this fellow could be a fink, even if he was\nhired right this minute! Not that I aim to be unfair to anybody, either.\nMaybe he ain\'t a fink," he cried passionately, "but brothers, I want to remind\nyou that nobody knows it; and it seems to me that anybody that would work\nunder that sonofabitching, double-crossing Brockway for more than fifteen\nminutes is just as apt as not to be naturally fink-minded! Please, brothers!"\nhe cried, waving his arms for quiet. "As some of you brothers have learned,\nto the sorrow of your wives and babies, a fink don\'t have to know about\ntrade unionism to be a fink! Finkism? Hell, I\'ve made a study of finkism!\nFinkism is born into some guys. It\'s born into some guys, just like a good\neye for color is born into other guys. That\'s right, that\'s the honest, scientific\ntruth! A fink don\'t even have to have heard of a union before," he cried in a\nfrenzy of words. "All you have to do is bring him around the neighborhood\nof a union and next thing you know, why, zip! he\'s finking his finking ass\noff!"\nHe was drowned out by shouts of approval. Men turned violently to\nlook at me. I felt choked. I wanted to drop my head but faced them as\nthough facing them was itself a denial of his statements. Another voice ripped\nout of the shouts of approval, spilling with great urgency from the lips of a\nlittle fellow with glasses who spoke with the index finger of one hand\nupraised and the thumb of the other crooked in the suspender of his overalls:\n"I want to put this brother\'s remarks in the form of a motion: I\nmove that we determine through a thorough investigation whether the new\nworker is a fink or no; and if he is a fink, let us discover who he\'s finking\nfor! And this, brother members, would give the worker time, if he ain\'t a\nfink, to become acquainted with the work of the union and its aims. After all,\nbrothers, we don\'t want to forget that workers like him aren\'t so highly\ndeveloped as some of us who\'ve been in the labor movement for a long time.\nSo I says, let\'s give him time to see what we\'ve done to improve the\ncondition of the workers, and then, if he ain\'t a fink, we can decide in a\ndemocratic way whether we want to accept this brother into the union.\nBrother union members, I thank you!" He sat down with a bump.\nThe room roared. Biting anger grew inside me. So I was not so\nhighly developed as they! What did he mean? Were they all Ph.D.\'s? I\ncouldn\'t move; too much was happening to me. It was as though by entering\nthe room I had automatically applied for membership -- even though I had\nno idea that a union existed, and had come up simply to get a cold pork\nchop sandwich. I stood trembling, afraid that they would ask me to join but\nangry that so many rejected me on sight. And worst of all, I knew they were\nforcing me to accept things on their own terms, and I was unable to leave.\n"All right, brothers. We\'ll take a vote," the chairman shouted. "All in\nfavor of the motion, signify by saying \'Aye\' . . ."\nThe ayes drowned him out.\n"The ayes carried it," the chairman announced as several men turned\nto stare at me. At last I could move. I started out, forgetting why I had\ncome.\n"Come in, brother," the chairman called. "You can get your lunch\nnow. Let him through, you brothers around the door!"\nMy face stung as though it had been slapped. They had made their\ndecision without giving me a chance to speak for myself. I felt that every\nman present looked upon me with hostility; and though I had lived with\nhostility all my life, now for the first time it seemed to reach me, as though\nI had expected more of these men than of others -- even though I had not\nknown of their existence. Here in this room my defenses were negated,\nstripped away, checked at the door as the weapons, the knives and razors and\nowlhead pistols of the country boys were checked on Saturday night at the\nGolden Day. I kept my eyes lowered, mumbling "Pardon me, pardon me," all\nthe way to the drab green locker, where I removed the sandwich, for which I\nno longer had an appetite, and stood fumbling with the bag, dreading to face\nthe men on my way out. Then still hating myself for the apologies made\ncoming over, I brushed past silently as I went back.\nWhen I reached the door the chairman called, "Just a minute,\nbrother, we want you to understand that this is nothing against you\npersonally. What you see here is the results of certain conditions here at the\nplant. We want you to know that we are only trying to protect ourselves.\nSome day we hope to have you as a member in good standing."\nFrom here and there came a half-hearted applause that quickly died.\nI swallowed and stared unseeing, the words spurting to me from a red, misty\ndistance.\n"Okay, brothers," the voice said, "let him pass."\nI STUMBLED through the bright sunlight of the yard, past the office\nworkers chatting on the grass, back to Building No. 2, to the basement. I\nstood on the stairs, feeling as though my bowels had been flooded with acid.\nWhy hadn\'t I simply left, I thought with anguish. And since I had\nremained, why hadn\'t I said something, defended myself? Suddenly I snatched\nthe wrapper off a sandwich and tore it violently with my teeth, hardly tasting\nthe dry lumps that squeezed past my constricted throat when I swallowed.\nDropping the remainder back into the bag, I held onto the handrail, my legs\nshaking as though I had just escaped a great danger. Finally, it went away\nand I pushed open the metal door.\n"What kept you so long?" Brockway snapped from where he sat on a\nwheelbarrow. He had been drinking from a white mug now cupped in his\ngrimy hands.\nI looked at him abstractedly, seeing how the light caught on his\nwrinkled forehead, his snowy hair. "I said, what kept you so long!" What had\nhe to do with it, I thought, looking at him through a kind of mist, knowing\nthat I disliked him and that I was very tired.\n"I say . . ." he began, and I heard my voice come quiet from my\ntensed throat as I noticed by the clock that I had been gone only twenty\nminutes. "I ran into a union meeting --"\n"Union!" I heard his white cup shatter against the floor as he\nuncrossed his legs, rising. "I knowed you belonged to that bunch of\ntroublemaking foreigners! I knowed it! Git out!" he screamed. "Git out of my\nbasement!"\nHe started toward me as in a dream, trembling like the needle of\none of the gauges as he pointed toward the stairs, his voice shrieking. I\nstared; something seemed to have gone wrong, my reflexes were jammed.\n"But what\'s the matter?" I stammered, my voice low and my mind\nunderstanding and yet failing exactly to understand. "What\'s wrong?"\n"You heard me. Git out!"\n"But I don\'t understand . . ."\n"Shut up and git!"\n"But, Mr. Brockway," I cried, fighting to hold something that was\ngiving way.\n"You two-bit, trouble-making union louse!"\n"Look, man," I cried, urgently now, "I don\'t belong to any union."\n"If you don\'t git outta here, you low-down skunk," he said, looking\nwildly about the floor, "I\'m liable to kill you. The Lord being my witness,\nI\'LL KILL YOU!"\nIt was incredible, things were speeding up. "You\'ll do what?" I\nstammered.\n"I\'LL KILL YOU, THAT\'S WHAT!"\nHe had said it again and something fell away from me, and I\nseemed to be telling myself in a rush: You were trained to accept the\nfoolishness of such old men as this, even when you thought them clowns and\nfools; you were trained to pretend that you respected them and acknowledged\nin them the same quality of authority and power in your world as the whites\nbefore whom they bowed and scraped and feared and loved and imitated, and\nyou were even trained to accept it when, angered or spiteful, or drunk with\npower, they came at you with a stick or strap or cane and you made no\neffort to strike back, but only to escape unmarked. But this was too much . .\n. he was not grandfather or uncle or father, nor preacher or teacher.\nSomething uncoiled in my stomach and I was moving toward him, shouting,\nmore at a black blur that irritated my eyes than at a clearly denned human\nface, "YOU\'LL KILL WHO?"\n"YOU, THAT\'S WHO!"\n"Listen here, you old fool, don\'t talk about killing me! Give me a\nchance to explain. I don\'t belong to anything -- Go on, pick it up! Go on!" I\nyelled, seeing his eyes fasten upon a twisted iron bar. "You\'re old enough to\nbe my grandfather, but if you touch that bar, I swear I\'ll make you eat it!"\n"I done tole you, GIT OUTTA MY BASEMENT! You impudent\nson\'bitch," he screamed.\nI moved forward, seeing him stoop and reach aside for the bar; and\nI was throwing myself forward, feeling him go over with a grunt, hard against\nthe floor, rolling beneath the force of my lunge. It was as though I had\nlanded upon a wiry rat. He scrambled beneath me, making angry sounds and\nstriking my face as he tried to use the bar. I twisted it from his grasp,\nfeeling a sharp pain stab through my shoulder. He\'s using a knife flashed\nthrough my mind and I slashed out with my elbow, sharp against his face,\nfeeling it land solid and seeing his head fly backwards and up and back again\nas I struck again, hearing something fly free and skitter across the floor,\nthinking, It\'s gone, the knife is gone . . . and struck again as he tried to\nchoke me, jabbing at his bobbing head, feeling the bar come free and\nbringing it down at his head, missing, the metal clinking against the floor,\nand bringing it up for a second try and him yelling, "No, no! You the best,\nyou the best!"\n"I\'m going to beat your brains out!" I said, my throat dry, "stabbing\nme . . ."\n"No," he panted. "I got enough. Ain\'t you heard me say I got\nenough?"\n"So when you can\'t win you want to stop! Damn you, if you\'ve cut\nme bad, I\'ll tear your head off!"\nWatching him warily, I got to my feet. I dropped the bar, as a flash\nof heat swept over me: His face was caved in.\n"What\'s wrong with you, old man?" I yelled nervously. "Don\'t you\nknow better than to attack a man a third your age?"\nHe blanched at being called old, and I repeated it, adding insults I\'d\nheard my grandfather use. "Why, you old-fashioned, slavery-time,\nmammy-made, handkerchief-headed bastard, you should know better! What\nmade you think you could threaten my life? You meant nothing to me, I\ncame down here because I was sent. I didn\'t know anything about you or the\nunion either. Why\'d you start riding me the minute I came in? Are you\npeople crazy? Does this paint go to your head? Are you drinking it?"\nHe glared, panting tiredly. Great tucks showed in his overalls where\nthe folds were stuck together by the goo with which he was covered, and I\nthought, Tar Baby, and wanted to blot him out of my sight. But now my\nanger was flowing fast from action to words.\n"I go to get my lunch and they ask me who I work for and when I\ntell them, they call me a fink. A fink! You people must be out of your minds.\nNo sooner do I get back down here than you start yelling that you\'re going\nto kill me! What\'s going on? What have you got against me? What did I do?"\nHe glowered at me silently, then pointed to the floor.\n"Reach and draw back a nub," I warned.\n"Caint a man even git his teeth?" he mumbled, his voice strange.\n"TEETH?"\nWith a shamed frown, he opened his mouth. I saw a blue flash of\nshrunken gums. The thing that had skittered across the floor was not a knife,\nbut a plate of false teeth. For a fraction of a second I was desperate, feeling\nsome of my justification for wanting to kill him slipping away. My fingers\nleaped to my shoulder, finding wet cloth but no blood. The old fool had\nbitten me. A wild flash of laughter struggled to rise from beneath my anger.\nHe had bitten me! I looked on the floor, seeing the smashed mug and the\nteeth glinting dully across the room.\n"Get them," I said, growing ashamed. Without his teeth, some of the\nhatefulness seemed to have gone out of him. But I stayed close as he got his\nteeth and went over to the tap and held them beneath a stream of water. A\ntooth fell away beneath the pressure of his thumb, and I heard him\ngrumbling as he placed the plate in his mouth. Then, wiggling his chin, he\nbecame himself again.\n"You was really trying to kill me," he said. He seemed unable to\nbelieve it.\n"You started the killing. I don\'t go around fighting," I said. "Why\ndidn\'t you let me explain? Is it against the law to belong to the union?"\n"That damn union," he cried, almost in tears. "That damn union!\nThey after my job! I know they after my job! For one of us to join one of\nthem damn unions is like we was to bite the hand of the man who teached\nus to bathe in a bathtub! I hates it, and I mean to keep on doing all I can\nto chase it outta the plant. They after my job, the chickenshit bastards!"\nSpittle formed at the corners of his mouth; he seemed to boil with\nhatred.\n"But what have I to do with that?" I said, feeling suddenly the older.\n" \'Cause them young colored fellers up in the lab is trying to join\nthat outfit, that\'s what! Here the white man done give \'em jobs," he wheezed\nas though pleading a case. "He done give \'em good jobs too, and they so\nungrateful they goes and joins up with that backbiting union! I never seen\nsuch a no-good ungrateful bunch. All they doing is making things bad for the\nrest of us!"\n"Well, I\'m sorry," I said, "I didn\'t know about all that. I came here\nto take a temporary job and I certainly didn\'t intend to get mixed up in any\nquarrels. But as for us, I\'m ready to forget our disagreement -- if you are . .\n." I held out my hand, causing my shoulder to pain.\nHe gave me a gruff look. "You ought to have more self-respect than\nto fight an old man," he said. "I got grown boys older than you."\n"I thought you were trying to kill me," I said, my hand still\nextended. "I thought you had stabbed me."\n"Well, I don\'t like a lot of bickering and confusion myself," he said,\navoiding my eyes. And it was as though the closing of his sticky hand over\nmine was a signal. I heard a shrill hissing from the boilers behind me and\nturned, hearing Brockway yell, "I tole you to watch them gauges. Git over to\nthe big valves, quick!"\nI dashed for where a series of valve wheels projected from the wall\nnear the crusher, seeing Brockway scrambling away in the other direction,\nthinking, Where\'s he going? as I reached the valves, and hearing him yell,\n"Turn it! Turn it!"\n"Which?" I yelled, reaching.\n"The white one, fool, the white one!"\nI jumped, catching it and pulling down with all my weight, feeling it\ngive. But this only increased the noise and I seemed to hear Brockway laugh\nas I looked around to see him scrambling for the stairs, his hands clasping\nthe back of his head, and his neck pulled in close, like a small boy who has\nthrown a brick into the air.\n"Hey you! Hey you!" I yelled. "Hey!" But it was too late. All my\nmovements seemed too slow, ran together. I felt the wheel resisting and tried\nvainly to reverse it and tried to let go, and it sticking to my palms and my\nfingers stiff and sticky, and I turned, running now, seeing the needle on one\nof the gauges swinging madly, like a beacon gone out of control, and trying\nto think clearly, my eyes darting here and there through the room of tanks\nand machines and up the stairs so far away and hearing the clear new note\narising while I seemed to run swiftly up an incline and shot forward with\nsudden acceleration into a wet blast of black emptiness that was somehow a\nbath of whiteness.\nIt was a fall into space that seemed not a fall but a suspension.\nThen a great weight landed upon me and I seemed to sprawl in an interval\nof clarity beneath a pile of broken machinery, my head pressed back against\na huge wheel, my body splattered with a stinking goo. Somewhere an engine\nground in furious futility, grating loudly until a pain shot around the curve of\nmy head and bounced me off into blackness for a distance, only to strike\nanother pain that lobbed me back. And in that clear instant of consciousness\nI opened my eyes to a blinding flash.\nHolding on grimly, I could hear the sound of someone wading,\nsloshing, nearby, and an old man\'s garrulous voice saying, "I tole \'em these\nhere young Nineteen-Hundred boys ain\'t no good for the job. They ain\'t got\nthe nerves. Naw, sir, they just ain\'t got the nerves."\nI tried to speak, to answer, but something heavy moved again, and I\nwas understanding something fully and trying again to answer but seemed to\nsink to the center of a lake of heavy water and pause, transfixed and numb\nwith the sense that I had lost irrevocably an important victory.\nChapter 11\nI was sitting in a cold, white rigid chair and a man was looking at\nme out of a bright third eye that glowed from the center of his forehead. He\nreached out, touching my skull gingerly, and said something encouraging, as\nthough I were a child. His fingers went away.\n"Take this," he said. "It\'s good for you." I swallowed. Suddenly my\nskin itched, all over. I had on new overalls, strange white ones. The taste ran\nbitter through my mouth. My fingers trembled.\nA thin voice with a mirror on the end of it said, "How is he?"\n"I don\'t think it\'s anything serious. Merely stunned."\n"Should he be sent home now?"\n"No, just to be certain we\'ll keep him here a few days. Want to keep\nhim under observation. Then he may leave."\nNow I was lying on a cot, the bright eye still burning into mine,\nalthough the man was gone. It was quiet and I was numb. I closed my eyes\nonly to be awakened.\n"What is your name?" a voice said.\n"My head . . ." I said.\n"Yes, but your name. Address?"\n"My head -- that burning eye . . ." I said.\n"Eye?"\n"Inside," I said.\n"Shoot him up for an X-ray," another voice said.\n"My head . . ."\n"Careful!"\nSomewhere a machine began to hum and I distrusted the man and\nwoman above me.\nThey were holding me firm and it was fiery and above it all I kept\nhearing the opening motif of Beethoven\'s Fifth -- three short and one long\nbuzz, repeated again and again in varying volume, and I was struggling and\nbreaking through, rising up, to find myself lying on my back with two\npink-faced men laughing down.\n"Be quiet now," one of them said firmly. "You\'ll be all right." I raised\nmy eyes, seeing two indefinite young women in white, looking down at me. A\nthird, a desert of heat waves away, sat at a panel arrayed with coils and\ndials. Where was I? From far below me a barber-chair thumping began and I\nfelt myself rise on the tip of the sound from the floor. A face was now level\nwith mine, looking closely and saying something without meaning. A whirring\nbegan that snapped and cracked with static, and suddenly I seemed to be\ncrushed between the floor and ceiling. Two forces tore savagely at my\nstomach and back. A flash of cold-edged heat enclosed me. I was pounded\nbetween crushing electrical pressures; pumped between live electrodes like an\naccordion between a player\'s hands. My lungs were compressed like a bellows\nand each time my breath returned I yelled, punctuating the rhythmical action\nof the nodes.\n"Hush, goddamit," one of the faces ordered. "We\'re trying to get you\nstarted again. Now shut up!"\nThe voice throbbed with icy authority and I quieted and tried to\ncontain the pain. I discovered now that my head was encircled by a piece of\ncold metal like the iron cap worn by the occupant of an electric chair. I tried\nunsuccessfully to struggle, to cry out. But the people were so remote, the pain\nso immediate. A faced moved in and out of the circle of lights, peering for a\nmoment, then disappeared. A freckled, red-haired woman with gold\nnose-glasses appeared; then a man with a circular mirror attached to his\nforehead -- a doctor. Yes, he was a doctor and the women were nurses; it\nwas coming clear. I was in a hospital. They would care for me. It was all\ngeared toward the easing of pain. I felt thankful.\nI tried to remember how I\'d gotten here, but nothing came. My mind\nwas blank, as though I had just begun to live. When the next face appeared I\nsaw the eyes behind the thick glasses blinking as though noticing me for the\nfirst time.\n"You\'re all right, boy. You\'re okay. You just be patient," said the\nvoice, hollow with profound detachment.\nI seemed to go away; the lights receded like a tail-light racing down\na dark country road. I couldn\'t follow. A sharp pain stabbed my shoulder. I\ntwisted about on my back, fighting something I couldn\'t see. Then after a\nwhile my vision cleared.\nNow a man sitting with his back to me, manipulating dials on a\npanel. I wanted to call him, but the Fifth Symphony rhythm racked me, and\nhe seemed too serene and too far away. Bright metal bars were between us\nand when I strained my neck around I discovered that I was not lying on an\noperating table but in a kind of glass and nickel box, the lid of which was\npropped open. Why was I here?\n"Doctor! Doctor!" I called.\nNo answer. Perhaps he hadn\'t heard, I thought, calling again and\nfeeling the stabbing pulses of the machine again and feeling myself going\nunder and fighting against it and coming up to hear voices carrying on a\nconversation behind my head. The static sounds became a quiet drone. Strains\nof music, a Sunday air, drifted from a distance. With closed eyes, barely\nbreathing I warded off the pain. The voices droned harmoniously. Was it a\nradio I heard -- a phonograph? The vox humana of a hidden organ? If so,\nwhat organ and where? I felt warm. Green hedges, dazzling with red wild\nroses appeared behind my eyes, stretching with a gentle curving to an infinity\nempty of objects, a limpid blue space. Scenes of a shaded lawn in summer\ndrifted past; I saw a uniformed military band arrayed decorously in concert,\neach musician with well-oiled hair, heard a sweet-voiced trumpet rendering\n"The Holy City" as from an echoing distance, buoyed by a choir of muted\nhorns; and above, the mocking obbligato of a mocking bird. I felt giddy. The\nair seemed to grow thick with fine white gnats, filling my eyes, boiling so\nthickly that the dark trumpeter breathed them in and expelled them through\nthe bell of his golden horn, a live white cloud mixing with the tones upon\nthe torpid air.\nI came back. The voices still droned above me and I disliked them.\nWhy didn\'t they go away? Smug ones. Oh, doctor, I thought drowsily, did you\never wade in a brook before breakfast? Ever chew on sugar cane? You know,\ndoc, the same fall day I first saw the hounds chasing black men in stripes\nand chains my grandmother sat with me and sang with twinkling eyes:\n"Godamighty made a monkey\nGodamighty made a whale\nAnd Godamighty made a \'gator\nWith hickeys all over his tail . . ."\nOr you, nurse, did you know that when you strolled in pink organdy\nand picture hat between the rows of cape jasmine, cooing to your beau in a\ndrawl as thick as sorghum, we little black boys hidden snug in the bushes\ncalled out so loud that you daren\'t hear:\n"Did you ever see Miss Margaret boil water?\nMan, she hisses a wonderful stream,\nSeventeen miles and a quarter,\nMan, and you can\'t see her pot for the steam . . ."\nBut now the music became a distinct wail of female pain. I opened\nmy eyes. Glass and metal floated above me.\n"How are you feeling, boy?" a voice said.\nA pair of eyes peered down through lenses as thick as the bottom of\na Coca-Cola bottle, eyes protruding, luminous and veined, like an old biology\nspecimen preserved in alcohol.\n"I don\'t have enough room," I said angrily.\n"Oh, that\'s a necessary part of the treatment."\n"But I need more room," I insisted. "I\'m cramped."\n"Don\'t worry about it, boy. You\'ll get used to it after a while. How is\nyour stomach and head?"\n"Stomach?"\n"Yes, and your head?"\n"I don\'t know," I said, realizing that I could feel nothing beyond the\npressure around my head and the tender surface of my body. Yet my senses\nseemed to focus sharply.\n"I don\'t feel it," I cried, alarmed.\n"Aha! You see! My little gadget will solve everything!" he exploded.\n"I don\'t know," another voice said. "I think I still prefer surgery. And\nin this case especially, with this, uh . . . background, I\'m not so sure that I\ndon\'t believe in the effectiveness of simple prayer."\n"Nonsense, from now on do your praying to my little machine. I\'ll\ndeliver the cure."\n"I don\'t know, but I believe it a mistake to assume that solutions --\ncures, that is -- that apply in, uh . . . primitive instances, are, uh . . .\nequally effective when more advanced conditions are in question. Suppose it\nwere a New Englander with a Harvard background?"\n"Now you\'re arguing politics," the first voice said banteringly.\n"Oh, no, but it is a problem."\nI listened with growing uneasiness to the conversation fuzzing away\nto a whisper. Their simplest words seemed to refer to something else, as did\nmany of the notions that unfurled through my head. I wasn\'t sure whether\nthey were talking about me or someone else. Some of it sounded like a\ndiscussion of history . . .\n"The machine will produce the results of a prefrontal lobotomy\nwithout the negative effects of the knife," the voice said. "You see, instead of\nsevering the prefrontal lobe, a single lobe, that is, we apply pressure in the\nproper degrees to the major centers of nerve control -- our concept is Gestalt\n-- and the result is as complete a change of personality as you\'ll find in your\nfamous fairy-tale cases of criminals transformed into amiable fellows after all\nthat bloody business of a brain operation. And what\'s more," the voice went\non triumphantly, "the patient is both physically and neurally whole."\n"But what of his psychology?"\n"Absolutely of no importance!" the voice said. "The patient will live\nas he has to live, and with absolute integrity. Who could ask more? He\'ll\nexperience no major conflict of motives, and what is even better, society will\nsuffer no traumata on his account."\nThere was a pause. A pen scratched upon paper. Then, "Why not\ncastration, doctor?" a voice asked waggishly, causing me to start, a pain\ntearing through me.\n"There goes your love of blood again," the first voice laughed.\n"What\'s that definition of a surgeon, \'A butcher with a bad conscience\'?"\nThey laughed.\n"It\'s not so funny. It would be more scientific to try to define the\ncase. It has been developing some three hundred years --"\n"Define? Hell, man, we know all that."\n"Then why don\'t you try more current?"\n"You suggest it?"\n"I do, why not?"\n"But isn\'t there a danger . . . ?" the voice trailed off.\nI heard them move away; a chair scraped. The machine droned, and\nI knew definitely that they were discussing me and steeled myself for the\nshocks, but was blasted nevertheless. The pulse came swift and staccato,\nincreasing gradually until I fairly danced between the nodes. My teeth\nchattered. I closed my eyes and bit my lips to smother my screams. Warm\nblood filled my mouth. Between my lids I saw a circle of hands and faces,\ndazzling with light. Some were scribbling upon charts.\n"Look, he\'s dancing," someone called.\n"No, really?"\nAn oily face looked in. "They really do have rhythm, don\'t they? Get\nhot, boy! Get hot!" it said with a laugh.\nAnd suddenly my bewilderment suspended and I wanted to be angry,\nmurderously angry. But somehow the pulse of current smashing through my\nbody prevented me. Something had been disconnected. For though I had\nseldom used my capacities for anger and indignation, I had no doubt that I\npossessed them; and, like a man who knows that he must fight, whether\nangry or not, when called a son of a bitch, I tried to imagine myself angry --\nonly to discover a deeper sense of remoteness. I was beyond anger. I was\nonly bewildered. And those above seemed to sense it. There was no avoiding\nthe shock and I rolled with the agitated tide, out into the blackness.\nWhen I emerged, the lights were still there. I lay beneath the slab of\nglass, feeling deflated. All my limbs seemed amputated. It was very warm. A\ndim white ceiling stretched far above me. My eyes were swimming with tears.\nWhy, I didn\'t know. It worried me. I wanted to knock on the glass to attract\nattention, but I couldn\'t move. The slightest effort, hardly more than desire,\ntired me. I lay experiencing the vague processes of my body. I seemed to\nhave lost all sense of proportion. Where did my body end and the crystal and\nwhite world begin? Thoughts evaded me, hiding in the vast stretch of clinical\nwhiteness to which I seemed connected only by a scale of receding grays. No\nsounds beyond the sluggish inner roar of the blood. I couldn\'t open my eyes.\nI seemed to exist in some other dimension, utterly alone; until after a while a\nnurse bent down and forced a warm fluid between my lips. I gagged,\nswallowed, feeling the fluid course slowly to my vague middle. A huge\niridescent bubble seemed to enfold me. Gentle hands moved over me,\nbringing vague impressions of memory. I was laved with warm liquids, felt\ngentle hands move through the indefinite limits of my flesh. The sterile and\nweightless texture of a sheet enfolded me. I felt myself bounce, sail off like a\nball thrown over the roof into mist, striking a hidden wall beyond a pile of\nbroken machinery and sailing back. How long it took, I didn\'t know. But now\nabove the movement of the hands I heard a friendly voice, uttering familiar\nwords to which I could assign no meaning. I listened intensely, aware of the\nform and movement of sentences and grasping the now subtle rhythmical\ndifferences between progressions of sound that questioned and those that\nmade a statement. But still their meanings were lost in the vast whiteness in\nwhich I myself was lost.\nOther voices emerged. Faces hovered above me like inscrutable fish\npeering myopically through a glass aquarium wall. I saw them suspended\nmotionless above me, then two floating off, first their heads, then the tips of\ntheir finlike fingers, moving dreamily from the top of the case. A thoroughly\nmysterious coming and going, like the surging of torpid tides. I watched the\ntwo make furious movements with their mouths. I didn\'t understand. They\ntried again, the meaning still escaping me. I felt uneasy. I saw a scribbled\ncard, held over me. All a jumble of alphabets. They consulted heatedly.\nSomehow I felt responsible. A terrible sense of loneliness came over me; they\nseemed to enact a mysterious pantomime. And seeing them from this angle\nwas disturbing. They appeared utterly stupid and I didn\'t like it. It wasn\'t\nright. I could see smut in one doctor\'s nose; a nurse had two flabby chins.\nOther faces came up, their mouths working with soundless fury. But we are\nall human, I thought, wondering what I meant.\nA man dressed in black appeared, a long-haired fellow, whose\npiercing eyes looked down upon me out of an intense and friendly face. The\nothers hovered about him, their eyes anxious as he alternately peered at me\nand consulted my chart. Then he scribbled something on a large card and\nthrust it before my eyes:\nWHAT IS YOUR NAME?\nA tremor shook me; it was as though he had suddenly given a name\nto, had organized the vagueness that drifted through my head, and I was\novercome with swift shame. I realized that I no longer knew my own name. I\nshut my eyes and shook my head with sorrow. Here was the first warm\nattempt to communicate with me and I was failing. I tried again, plunging\ninto the blackness of my mind. It was no use; I found nothing but pain. I\nsaw the card again and he pointed slowly to each word:\nWHAT . . . IS . . . YOUR . . . NAME?\nI tried desperately, diving below the blackness until I was limp with\nfatigue. It was as though a vein had been opened and my energy syphoned\naway; I could only stare back mutely. But with an irritating burst of activity\nhe gestured for another card and wrote:\nWHO . . . ARE . . . YOU?\nSomething inside me turned with a sluggish excitement. This phrasing\nof the question seemed to set off a series of weak and distant lights where\nthe other had thrown a spark that failed. Who am I? I asked myself. But it\nwas like trying to identify one particular cell that coursed through the torpid\nveins of my body. Maybe I was just this blackness and bewilderment and\npain, but that seemed less like a suitable answer than something I\'d read\nsomewhere.\nThe card was back again:\nWHAT IS YOUR MOTHER\'S NAME?\nMother, who was my mother? Mother, the one who screams when\nyou suffer -- but who? This was stupid, you always knew your mother\'s\nname. Who was it that screamed? Mother? But the scream came from the\nmachine. A machine my mother? . . . Clearly, I was out of my head.\nHe shot questions at me: Where were you born? Try to think of your\nname.\nI tried, thinking vainly of many names, but none seemed to fit, and\nyet it was as though I was somehow a part of all of them, had become\nsubmerged within them and lost.\nYou must remember, the placard read. But it was useless. Each time\nI found myself back in the clinging white mist and my name just beyond my\nfingertips. I shook my head and watched him disappear for a moment and\nreturn with a companion, a short, scholarly looking man who stared at me\nwith a blank expression. I watched him produce a child\'s slate and a piece of\nchalk, writing upon it:\nWHO WAS YOUR MOTHER?\nI looked at him, feeling a quick dislike and thinking, half in\namusement, I don\'t play the dozens. And how\'s your old lady today?\nTHINK\nI stared, seeing him frown and write a long time. The slate was filled\nwith meaningless names.\nI smiled, seeing his eyes blaze with annoyance. Old Friendly Face\nsaid something. The new man wrote a question at which I stared in\nwide-eyed amazement:\nWHO WAS BUCKEYE THE RABBIT?\nI was filled with turmoil. Why should he think of that? He pointed\nto the question, word by word. I laughed, deep, deep inside me, giddy with\nthe delight of self-discovery and the desire to hide it. Somehow I was\nBuckeye the Rabbit . . . or had been, when as children we danced and sang\nbarefoot in the dusty streets:\nBuckeye the Rabbit\nShake it, shake it\nBuckeye the Rabbit\nBreak it, break it . . .\nYet, I could not bring myself to admit it, it was too ridiculous -- and\nsomehow too dangerous. It was annoying that he had hit upon an old\nidentity and I shook my head, seeing him purse his lips and eye me sharply.\nBOY, WHO WAS BRER RABBIT?\nHe was your mother\'s back-door man, I thought. Anyone knew they\nwere one and the same: "Buckeye" when you were very young and hid\nyourself behind wide innocent eyes; "Brer," when you were older. But why\nwas he playing around with these childish names? Did they think I was a\nchild? Why didn\'t they leave me alone? I would remember soon enough when\nthey let me out of the machine . . . A palm smacked sharply upon the glass,\nbut I was tired of them. Yet as my eyes focused upon Old Friendly Face he\nseemed pleased. I couldn\'t understand it, but there he was, smiling and\nleaving witrr the new assistant.\nLeft alone, I lay fretting over my identity. I suspected that I was\nreally playing a game with myself and that they were taking part. A kind of\ncombat. Actually they knew as well as I, and I for some reason preferred not\nto face it. It was irritating, and it made me feel sly and alert. I would solve\nthe mystery the next instant. I imagined myself whirling about in my mind\nlike an old man attempting to catch a small boy in some mischief, thinking,\nWho am I? It was no good. I felt like a clown. Nor was I up to being both\ncriminal and detective -- though why criminal I didn\'t know.\nI fell to plotting ways of short-circuiting the machine. Perhaps if I\nshifted my body about so that the two nodes would come together -- No, not\nonly was there no room but it might electrocute me. I shuddered. Whoever\nelse I was, I was no Samson. I had no desire to destroy myself even if it\ndestroyed the machine; I wanted freedom, not destruction. It was exhausting,\nfor no matter what the scheme I conceived, there was one constant flaw --\nmyself. There was no getting around it. I could no more escape than I could\nthink of my identity. Perhaps, I thought, the two things are involved with\neach other. When I discover who I am, I\'ll be free.\nIt was as though my thoughts of escape had alerted them. I looked\nup to see two agitated physicians and a nurse, and thought, It\'s too late now,\nand lay in a veil of sweat watching them manipulate the controls. I was\nbraced for the usual shock, but nothing happened. Instead I saw their hands\nat the lid, loosening the bolts, and before I could react they had opened the\nlid and pulled me erect.\n"What\'s happened?" I began, seeing the nurse pause to look at me.\n"Well?" she said.\nMy mouth worked soundlessly.\n"Come on, get it out," she said.\n"What hospital is this?" I said.\n"It\'s the factory hospital," she said. "Now be quiet."\nThey were around me now, inspecting my body, and I watched with\ngrowing bewilderment, thinking, what is a factory hospital?\nI felt a tug at my belly and looked down to see one of the\nphysicians pull the cord which was attached to the stomach node, jerking me\nforward.\n"What is this?" I said.\n"Get the shears," he said.\n"Sure," the other said. "Let\'s not waste time."\nI recoiled inwardly as though the cord were part of me. Then they\nhad it free and the nurse clipped through the belly band and removed the\nheavy node. I opened my mouth to speak but one of the physicians shook his\nhead. They worked swiftly. The nodes off, the nurse went over me with\nrubbing alcohol. Then I was told to climb out of the case. I looked from face\nto face, overcome with indecision. For now that it appeared that I was being\nfreed, I dared not believe it. What if they were transferring me to some even\nmore painful machine? I sat there, refusing to move. Should I struggle against\nthem?\n"Take his arm," one of them said.\n"I can do it," I said, climbing fearfully out.\nI was told to stand while they went over my body with the\nstethoscope.\n"How\'s the articulation?" the one with the chart said as the other\nexamined my shoulder.\n"Perfect," he said.\nI could feel a tightness there but no pain.\n"I\'d say he\'s surprisingly strong, considering," the other said.\n"Shall we call in Drexel? It seems rather unusual for him to be so\nstrong."\n"No, just note it on the chart."\n"All right, nurse, give him his clothes."\n"What are you going to do with me?" I said. She handed me clean\nunderclothing and a pair of white overalls.\n"No questions," she said. "Just dress as quickly as possible."\nThe air outside the machine seemed extremenly rare. When I bent\nover to tie my shoes I thought I would faint, but fought it off. I stood\nshakily and they looked me up and down.\n"Well, boy, it looks as though you\'re cured," one of them said.\n"You\'re a new man. You came through fine. Come with us," he said.\nWe went slowly out of the room and down a long white corridor into\nan elevator, then swiftly down three floors to a reception room with rows of\nchairs. At the front were a number of private offices with frosted glass doors\nand walls.\n"Sit down there," they said. "The director will see you shortly."\nI sat, seeing them disappear inside one of the offices for a second\nand emerge, passing me without a word. I trembled like a leaf. Were they\nreally freeing me? My head spun. I looked at my white overalls. The nurse\nsaid that this was the factory hospital . . . Why couldn\'t I remember what\nkind of factory it was? And why a factory hospital? Yes . . . I did remember\nsome vague factory; perhaps I was being sent back there. Yes, and he\'d\nspoken of the director instead of the head doctor; could they be one and the\nsame? Perhaps I was in the factory already. I listened but could hear no\nmachinery.\nACROSS the room a newspaper lay on a chair, but I was too\nconcerned to get it. Somewhere a fan droned. Then one of the doors with\nfrosted glass was opened and I saw a tall austere-looking man in a white\ncoat, beckoning to me with a chart.\n"Come," he said.\nI got up and went past him into a large simply furnished office,\nthinking, Now, I\'ll know. Now.\n"Sit down," he said.\nI eased myself into the chair beside his desk. He watched me with a\ncalm, scientific gaze.\n"What is your name? Oh here, I have it," he said, studying the chart.\nAnd it was as though someone inside of me tried to tell him to be silent, but\nalready he had called my name and I heard myself say, "Oh!" as a pain\nstabbed through my head and I shot to my feet and looked wildly around me\nand sat down and got up and down again very fast, remembering. I don\'t\nknow why I did it, but suddenly I saw him looking at me intently, and I\nstayed down this time.\nHe began asking questions and I could hear myself replying fluently,\nthough inside I was reeling with swiftly changing emotional images that\nshrilled and chattered, like a sound-track reversed at high speed.\n"Well, my boy," he said, "you\'re cured. We are going to release you.\nHow does that strike you?"\nSuddenly I didn\'t know. I noticed a company calendar beside a\nstethoscope and a miniature silver paint brush. Did he mean from the\nhospital or from the job? . . .\n"Sir?" I said.\n"I said, how does that strike you?"\n"All right, sir," I said in an unreal voice. "I\'ll be glad to get back to\nwork."\nHe looked at the chart, frowning. "You\'ll be released, but I\'m afraid\nthat you\'ll be disappointed about the work," he said.\n"What do you mean, sir?"\n"You\'ve been through a severe experience," he said. "You aren\'t ready\nfor the rigors of industry. Now I want you to rest, undertake a period of\nconvalescence. You need to become readjusted and get your strength back."\n"But, sir --"\n"You mustn\'t try to go too fast. You\'re glad to be released, are you\nnot?"\n"Oh, yes. But how shall I live?"\n"Live?" his eyebrows raised and lowered. "Take another job," he said.\n"Something easier, quieter. Something for which you\'re better prepared."\n"Prepared?" I looked at him, thinking, Is he in on it too? "I\'ll take\nanything, sir," I said.\n"That isn\'t the problem, my boy. You just aren\'t prepared for work\nunder our industrial conditions. Later, perhaps, but not now. And remember,\nyou\'ll be adequately compensated for your experience."\n"Compensated, sir?"\n"Oh, yes," he said. "We follow a policy of enlightened\nhumanitarianism; all our employees are automatically insured. You have only\nto sign a few papers."\n"What kind of papers, sir?"\n"We require an affidavit releasing the company of responsibility," he\nsaid. "Yours was a difficult case, and a number of specialists had to be called\nin. But, after all, any new occupation has its hazards. They are part of\ngrowing up, of becoming adjusted, as it were. One takes a chance and while\nsome are prepared, others are not."\nI looked at his lined face. Was he doctor, factory official, or both? I\ncouldn\'t get it; and now he seemed to move back and forth across my field\nof vision, although he sat perfectly calm in his chair.\nIt came out of itself: "Do you know Mr. Norton, sir?" I said.\n"Norton?" His brows knitted. "What Norton is this?"\nThen it was as though I hadn\'t asked him; the name sounded\nstrange. I ran my hand over my eyes.\n"I\'m sorry," I said. "It occurred to me that you might. He was just a\nman I used to know."\n"I see. Well" -- he picked up some papers -- "so that\'s the way it is,\nmy boy. A little later perhaps we\'ll be able to do something. You may take\nthe papers along if you wish. Just mail them to us. Your check will be sent\nupon their return. Meanwhile, take as much time as you like. You\'ll find that\nwe are perfectly fair."\nI took the folded papers and looked at him for what seemed to be\ntoo long a time. He seemed to waver. Then I heard myself say, "Do you\nknow him?" my voice rising.\n"Who?"\n"Mr. Norton," I said. "Mr. Norton!"\n"Oh, why, no."\n"No," I said, "no one knows anybody and it was too long a time\nago."\nHe frowned and I laughed. "They picked poor Robin clean," I said.\n"Do you happen to know Bled?"\nHe looked at me, his head to one side. "Are these people friends of\nyours?"\n"Friends? Oh, yes," I said, "we\'re all good friends. Buddies from way\nback. But I don\'t suppose we get around in the same circles."\nHis eyes widened. "No," he said, "I don\'t suppose we do. However,\ngood friends are valuable to have."\nI felt light-headed and started to laugh and he seemed to waver\nagain and I thought of asking him about Emerson, but now he was clearing\nhis throat and indicating that he was finished.\nI put the folded papers in my overalls and started out. The door\nbeyond the rows of chairs seemed far away.\n"Take care of yourself," he said.\n"And you," I said, thinking, it\'s time, it\'s past time.\nTurning abruptly, I went weakly back to the desk, seeing him looking\nup at me with his steady scientific gaze. I was overcome with ceremonial\nfeelings but unable to remember the proper formula. So as I deliberately\nextended my hand I fought down laughter with a cough.\n"It\'s been quite pleasant, our little palaver, sir," I said. I listened to\nmyself and to his answer.\n"Yes, indeed," he said.\nHe shook my hand gravely, without surprise or distaste. I looked\ndown, he was there somewhere behind the lined face and outstretched hand.\n"And now our palaver is finished," I said. "Good-bye."\nHe raised his hand. "Good-bye," he said, his voice noncommittal.\nLeaving him and going out into the paint-fuming air I had the\nfeeling that I had been talking beyond myself, had used words and expressed\nattitudes not my own, that I was in the grip of some alien personality lodged\ndeep within me. Like the servant about whom I\'d read in psychology class\nwho, during a trance, had recited pages of Greek philosophy which she had\noverheard one day while she worked. It was as though I were acting out a\nscene from some crazy movie. Or perhaps I was catching up with myself and\nhad put into words feelings which I had hitherto suppressed. Or was it, I\nthought, starting up the walk, that I was no longer afraid? I stopped, looking\nat the buildings down the bright street slanting with sun and shade. I was no\nlonger afraid. Not of important men, not of trustees and such; for knowing\nnow that there was nothing which I could expect from them, there was no\nreason to be afraid. Was that it? I felt light-headed, my ears were ringing. I\nwent on.\nAlong the walk the buildings rose, uniform and close together. It was\nday\'s end now and on top of every building the flags were fluttering and\ndiving down, collapsing. And I felt that I would fall, had fallen, moved now\nas against a current sweeping swiftly against me. Out of the grounds and up\nthe street I found the bridge by which I\'d come, but the stairs leading back\nto the car that crossed the top were too dizzily steep to climb, swim or fly,\nand I found a subway instead.\nThings whirled too fast around me. My mind went alternately bright\nand blank in slow rolling waves. We, he, him -- my mind and I -- were no\nlonger getting around in the same circles. Nor my body either. Across the\naisle a young platinum blonde nibbled at a red Delicious apple as station\nlights rippled past behind her. The train plunged. I dropped through the roar,\ngiddy and vacuum-minded, sucked under and out into late afternoon Harlem.\nChapter 12\nWhen I came out of the subway, Lenox Avenue seemed to careen\naway from me at a drunken angle, and I focused upon the teetering scene\nwith wild, infant\'s eyes, my head throbbing. Two huge women with\nspoiled-cream complexions seemed to struggle with their massive bodies as\nthey came past, their flowered hips trembling like threatening flames. Out\nacross the walk before me they moved, and a bright orange slant of sun\nseemed to boil up and I saw myself going down, my legs watery beneath me,\nbut my head clear, too clear, recording the crowd swerving around me: legs,\nfeet, eyes, hands, bent knees, scuffed shoes, teethy-eyed excitement; and some\nmoving on unhalting.\nAnd the big dark woman saying, Boy, is you all right, what\'s wrong?\nin a husky-voiced contralto. And me saying, I\'m all right, just weak, and\ntrying to stand, and her saying, Why don\'t y\'all stand back and let the man\nbreathe? Stand back there y\'all, and now echoed by an official tone, Keep\nmoving, break it up. And she on one side and a man on the other, helping\nme to stand and the policeman saying, Are you all right? and me answering,\nYes, I just felt weak, must have fainted but all right now, and him ordering\nthe crowd to move on and the others moving on except the man and woman\nand him saying, You sure you okay, daddy, and me nodding yes, and her\nsaying, Where you live son, somewhere around here? And me telling her\nMen\'s House and her looking at me shaking her head saying, Men\'s House,\nMen\'s House, shucks that ain\'t no place for nobody in your condition what\'s\nweak and needs a woman to keep an eye on you awhile. And me saying, But\nI\'ll be all right now, and her, Maybe you will and maybe you won\'t. I live\njust up the street and round the corner, you better come on round and rest\ntill you feel stronger. I\'ll phone Men\'s House and tell \'em where you at. And\nme too tired to resist and already she had one arm and was instructing the\nfellow to take the other and we went, me between them, inwardly rejecting\nand yet accepting her bossing, hearing, You take it easy, I\'ll take care of you\nlike I done a heap of others, my name\'s Mary Rambo, everybody knows me\nround this part of Harlem, you heard of me, ain\'t you? And the fellow saying,\nSure, I\'m Jenny Jackson\'s boy, you know I know you, Miss Mary. And her\nsaying, Jenny Jackson, why, I should say you do know me and I know you,\nyou Ralston, and your mama got two more children, boy named Flint and gal\nnamed Laurajean, I should say I know you -- me and your mama and your\npapa useta -- And me saying, I\'m all right now, really all right. And her\nsaying, And looking like that, you must be worse off even than you look, and\npulling me now saying, Here\'s my house right here, hep me git him up the\nsteps and inside, you needn\'t worry, son, I ain\'t never laid eyes on you before\nand it ain\'t my business and I don\'t care what you think about me but you\nweak and caint hardly walk and all and you look what\'s more like you\nhungry, so just come on and let me do something for you like I hope you\'d\ndo something for ole Mary in case she needed it, it ain\'t costing you a penny\nand I don\'t want to git in your business, I just want you to lay down till you\nrested and then you can go. And the fellow taking it up, saying, You in good\nhands, daddy, Miss Mary always helping somebody and you need some help\n\'cause here you black as me and white as a sheet, as the ofays would say --\nwatch these steps. And going up some steps and then some more, growing\nweaker, and the two warm around me on each side of me, and then inside a\ncool dark room, hearing, Here, here\'s the bed, lie him down there, there,\nthere now, that\'s it, Ralston, now put his legs up -- never mind the cover --\nthere, that\'s it, now go out there in the kitchen and pour him a glass of\nwater, you\'ll find a bottle in the ice-box. And him going and her placing\nanother pillow beneath my head, saying, Now you\'ll be better and when you\ngit all right you\'ll know how bad a shape you been in, here, now taka sip of\nthis water, and me drinking and seeing her worn brown fingers holding the\nbright glass and a feeling of old, almost forgotten relief coming over me and\nthinking in echo of her words, If I don\'t think I\'m sinking, look what a hole\nI\'m in, and then the soft cool splash of sleep.\nI SAW her across the room when I awoke, reading a newspaper, her\nglasses low across the bridge of her nose as she stared at the page intently.\nThen I realized that though the glasses still slanted down, the eyes were no\nlonger focused on the page, but on my face and lighting with a slow smile.\n"How you feel now?" she said.\n"Much better."\n"I thought you would be. And you be even better after you have a\ncup of soup I got for you in the kitchen. You slept a good long time."\n"Did I?" I said. "What time is it?"\n"It\'s about ten o\'clock, and from the way you slept I suspects all you\nneeded was some rest . . . No, don\'t git up yet. You got to drink your soup,\nthen you can go," she said, leaving.\nShe returned with a bowl in a plate. "This here\'ll fix you up," she\nsaid. "You don\'t get this kind of service up there at Men\'s House, do you?\nNow, you just sit there and take your time. I ain\'t got nothing to do but read\nthe paper. And I like company. You have to make time in the morning?"\n"No, I\'ve been sick," I said. "But I have to look for a job."\n"I knowed you wasn\'t well. Why you try to hide it?"\n"I didn\'t want to be trouble to anyone," I said.\n"Everybody has to be trouble to somebody. And you just come from\nthe hospital too."\nI looked up. She sat in the rocking chair bent forward, her arms\nfolded at ease across her aproned lap. Had she searched my pockets?\n"How did you know that?" I said.\n"There you go getting suspicious," she said sternly. "That\'s what\'s\nwrong with the world today, don\'t nobody trust nobody. I can smell that\nhospital smell on you, son. You got enough ether in those clothes to put to\nsleep a dog!"\n"I couldn\'t remember telling you that I had been in the hospital."\n"No, and you didn\'t have to. I smelled that out. You got people here\nin the city?"\n"No, ma\'m," I said. "They\'re down South. I came up here to work so\nI could go to school, and I got sick."\n"Now ain\'t that too bad! But you\'ll make out all right. What you plan\nto make out of yourself?"\n"I don\'t know now; I came here wanting to be an educator. Now I\ndon\'t know."\n"So what\'s wrong with being an educator?"\nI thought about it while sipping the good hot soup. "Nothing, I\nsuppose, I just think I\'d like to do something else."\n"Well, whatever it is, I hope it\'s something that\'s a credit to the\nrace."\n"I hope so," I said.\n"Don\'t hope, make it that way."\nI looked at her thinking of what I\'d tried to do and of where it had\ngotten me, seeing her heavy, composed figure before me.\n"It\'s you young folks what\'s going to make the changes," she said.\n"Y\'all\'s the ones. You got to lead and you got to fight and move us all on up\na little higher. And I tell you something else, it\'s the one\'s from the South\nthat\'s got to do it, them what knows the fire and ain\'t forgot how it burns.\nUp here too many forgits. They finds a place for theyselves and forgits the\nones on the bottom. Oh, heap of them talks about doing things, but they\ndone really forgot. No, it\'s you young ones what has to remember and take\nthe lead."\n"Yes," I said.\n"And you have to take care of yourself, son. Don\'t let this Harlem git\nyou. I\'m in New York but New York ain\'t in me, understand what I mean?\nDon\'t git corrupted."\n"I won\'t. I\'ll be too busy."\n"All right now, you looks to me like you might make something out\nof yourself, so you be careful."\nI got up to go, watching her raise herself out of her chair and come\nwith me to the door.\n"You ever decide you want a room somewhere beside Men\'s House,\ntry me," she said. "The rent\'s reasonable."\n"I\'ll remember that," I said.\nI WAS to remember sooner than I had thought. The moment I\nentered the bright, buzzing lobby of Men\'s House I was overcome by a sense\nof alienation and hostility. My overalls were causing stares and I knew that I\ncould live there no longer, that that phase of my life was past. The lobby was\nthe meeting place for various groups still caught up in the illusions that had\njust been boomeranged out of my head: college boys working to return to\nschool down South; older advocates of racial progress with Utopian schemes\nfor building black business empires; preachers ordained by no authority except\ntheir own, without church or congregation, without bread or wine, body or\nblood; the community "leaders" without followers; old men of sixty or more\nstill caught up in post-Civil-War dreams of freedom within segregation; the\npathetic ones who possessed nothing beyond their dreams of being gentlemen,\nwho held small jobs or drew small pensions, and all pretending to be\nengaged in some vast, though obscure, enterprise, who affected the\npseudo-courtly manners of certain southern congressmen and bowed and\nnodded as they passed like senile old roosters in a barnyard; the younger\ncrowd for whom I now felt a contempt such as only a disillusioned dreamer\nfeels for those still unaware that they dream -- the business students from\nsouthern colleges, for whom business was a vague, abstract game with rules\nas obsolete as Noah\'s Ark but who yet were drunk on finance. Yes, and that\nolder group with similar aspirations, the "fundamentalists," the "actors" who\nsought to achieve the status of brokers through imagination alone, a group of\njanitors and messengers who spent most of their wages on clothing such as\nwas fashionable among Wall Street brokers, with their Brooks Brothers suits\nand bowler hats, English umbrellas, black calfskin shoes and yellow gloves;\nwith their orthodox and passionate argument as to what was the correct tie\nto wear with what shirt, what shade of gray was correct for spats and what\nwould the Prince of Wales wear at a certain seasonal event; should field\nglasses be slung from the right or from the left shoulder; who never read the\nfinancial pages though they purchased the Wall Street Journal religiously and\ncarried it beneath the left elbow, pressed firm against the body and grasped\nin the left hand -- always manicured and gloved, fair weather or foul -- with\nan easy precision (Oh, they had style) while the other hand whipped a tightly\nrolled umbrella back and forth at a calculated angle; with their homburgs and\nChesterfields, their polo coats and Tyrolean hats worn strictly as fashion\ndemanded.\nI could feel their eyes, saw them all and saw too the time when they\nwould know that my prospects were ended and saw already the contempt\nthey\'d feel for me, a college man who had lost his prospects and pride. I\ncould see it all and I knew that even the officials and the older men would\ndespise me as though, somehow, in losing my place in Bledsoe\'s world I had\nbetrayed them . . . I saw it as they looked at my overalls.\nI had started toward the elevator when I heard the voice raised in\nlaughter and turned to see him holding forth to a group in the lobby chairs\nand the rolls of fat behind the wrinkled, high-domed, close-cut head, and I\nwas certain that it was he and stooped without thought and lifted it shining,\nfull and foul, and moved forward two long steps, dumping its great brown,\ntransparent splash upon the head warned too late by someone across the\nroom. And too late for me to see that it was not Bledsoe but a preacher, a\nprominent Baptist, who shot up wide-eyed with disbelief and outrage, and I\nshot around and out of the lobby before anyone could think to stop me.\nNo one followed me and I wandered the streets amazed at my own\naction. Later it began to rain and I sneaked back near Men\'s House and\npersuaded an amused porter to slip my things out to me. I learned that I\nhad been barred from the building for "ninety-nine years and a day."\n"You might not can come back, man," the porter said, "but after\nwhat you did, I swear, they never will stop talking about you. You really\nbaptized ole Rev!"\nSo THAT same night I went back to Mary\'s, where I lived in a small\nbut comfortable room until the ice came.\nIt was a period of quietness. I paid my way with my compensation\nmoney and found living with her pleasant except for her constant talk about\nleadership and responsibility. And even this was not too bad as long as I\ncould pay my way. It was, however, a small compensation, and when after\nseveral months my money ran out and I was looking again for a job, I found\nher exceedingly irritating to listen to. Still, she never dunned me and was as\ngenerous with her servings of food during mealtime as ever. "It\'s just hard\ntimes you going through," she\'d say. "Everybody worth his salt has his hard\ntimes, and when you git to be somebody you\'ll see these here very same hard\ntimes helped you a heap."\nI didn\'t see it that way. I had lost my sense of direction. I spent my\ntime, when not looking for work, in my room, where I read countless books\nfrom the library. Sometimes, when there was still money, or when I had\nearned a few dollars waiting table, I\'d eat out and wander the streets until\nlate at night. Other than Mary I had no friends and desired none. Nor did I\nthink of Mary as a "friend"; she was something more -- a force, a stable,\nfamiliar force like something out of my past which kept me from whirling off\ninto some unknown which I dared not face. It was a most painful position,\nfor at the same time, Mary reminded me constantly that something was\nexpected of me, some act of leadership, some newsworthy achievement; and I\nwas torn between resenting her for it and loving her for the nebulous hope\nshe kept alive.\nI had no doubt that I could do something, but what, and how? I had\nno contacts and I believed in nothing. And the obsession with my identity\nwhich I had developed in the factory hospital returned with a vengeance.\nWho was I, how had I come to be? Certainly I couldn\'t help being different\nfrom when I left the campus; but now a new, painful, contradictory voice had\ngrown up within me, and between its demands for revengeful action and\nMary\'s silent pressure I throbbed with guilt and puzzlement. I wanted peace\nand quiet, tranquillity, but was too much aboil inside. Somewhere beneath the\nload of the emotion-freezing ice which my life had conditioned my brain to\nproduce, a spot of black anger glowed and threw off a hot red light of such\nintensity that had Lord Kelvin known of its existence, he would have had to\nrevise his measurements. A remote explosion had occurred somewhere,\nperhaps back at Emerson\'s or that night in Bledsoe\'s office, and it had caused\nthe ice cap to melt and shift the slightest bit. But that bit, that fraction, was\nirrevocable. Coming to New York had perhaps been an unconscious attempt to\nkeep the old freezing unit going, but it hadn\'t worked; hot water had gotten\ninto its coils. Only a drop, perhaps, but that drop was the first wave of the\ndeluge. One moment I believed, I was dedicated, willing to lie on the blazing\ncoals, do anything to attain a position on the campus -- then snap! It was\ndone with, finished, through. Now there was only the problem of forgetting it.\nIf only all the contradictory voices shouting inside my head would calm down\nand sing a song in unison, whatever it was I wouldn\'t care as long as they\nsang without dissonance; yes, and avoided the uncertain extremes of the scale.\nBut there was no relief. I was wild with resentment but too much under\n"self-control," that frozen virtue, that freezing vice. And the more resentful I\nbecame, the more my old urge to make speeches returned. While walking\nalong the streets words would spill from my lips in a mumble over which I\nhad little control. I became afraid of what I might do. All things were indeed\nawash in my mind. I longed for home.\nAnd while the ice was melting to form a flood in which I threatened\nto drown I awoke one afternoon to find that my first northern winter had\nset.\nChapter 13\nAt first I had turned away from the window and tried to read but\nmy mind kept wandering back to my old problems and, unable to endure it\nany longer, I rushed from the house, extremely agitated but determined to get\naway from my hot thoughts into the chill air.\nAt the entrance I bumped against a woman who called me a filthy\nname, only causing me to increase my speed. In a few minutes I was several\nblocks away, having moved to the next avenue and downtown. The streets\nwere covered with ice and soot-flecked snow and from above a feeble sun\nfiltered through the haze. I walked with my head down, feeling the biting air.\nAnd yet I was hot, burning with an inner fever. I barely raised my eyes until\na car, passing with a thudding of skid chains whirled completely around on\nthe ice, then turned cautiously and thudded off again.\nI walked slowly on, blinking my eyes in the chill air, my mind a blur\nwith the hot inner argument continuing. The whole of Harlem seemed to fall\napart in the swirl of snow. I imagined I was lost and for a moment there\nwas an eerie quiet. I imagined I heard the fall of snow upon snow. What did\nit mean? I walked, my eyes focused into the endless succession of barber\nshops, beauty parlors, confectioneries, luncheonettes, fish houses, and hog\nmaw joints, walking close to the windows, the snowflakes lacing swift\nbetween, simultaneously forming a curtain, a veil, and stripping it aside. A\nflash of red and gold from a window filled with religious articles caught my\neye. And behind the film of frost etching the glass I saw two brashly painted\nplaster images of Mary and Jesus surrounded by dream books, love powders,\nGod-Is-Love signs, money-drawing oil and plastic dice. A black statue of a\nnude Nubian slave grinned out at me from beneath a turban of gold. I\npassed on to a window decorated with switches of wiry false hair, ointments\nguaranteed to produce the miracle of whitening black skin. "You too can be\ntruly beautiful," a sign proclaimed. "Win greater happiness with whiter\ncomplexion. Be outstanding in your social set."\nI hurried on, suppressing a savage urge to push my fist through the\npane. A wind was rising, the snow thinning. Where would I go? To a movie?\nCould I sleep there? I ignored the windows now and walked along, becoming\naware that I was muttering to myself again. Then far down at the corner I\nsaw an old man warming his hands against the sides of an odd-looking\nwagon, from which a stovepipe reeled off a thin spiral of smoke that drifted\nthe odor of baking yams slowly to me, bringing a stab of swift nostalgia. I\nstopped as though struck by a shot, deeply inhaling, remembering, my mind\nsurging back, back. At home we\'d bake them in the hot coals of the fireplace,\nhad carried them cold to school for lunch, munched them secretly, squeezing\nthe sweet pulp from the soft peel as we hid from the teacher behind the\nlargest book, the World\'s Geography. Yes, and we\'d loved them candied, or\nbaked in a cobbler, deep-fat fried in a pocket of dough, or roasted with pork\nand glazed with the well-browned fat; had chewed them raw -- yams and\nyears ago. More yams than years ago though the time seemed endlessly\nexpanded, stretched thin as the spiraling smoke beyond all recall.\nI moved again. "Get yo\' hot, baked Car\'lina yam," he called. At the\ncorner the old man, wrapped in an army overcoat, his feet covered with\ngunny sacks, his head in a knitted cap, was puttering with a stack of paper\nbags. I saw a crude sign on the side of the wagon proclaiming YAMS, as I\nwalked flush into the warmth thrown by the coals that glowed in a grate\nunderneath.\n"How much are your yams?" I said, suddenly hungry.\n"They ten cents and they sweet," he said, his voice quavering with\nage. "These ain\'t none of them binding ones neither. These here is real,\nsweet, yaller yams. How many?"\n"One," I said. "If they\'re that good, one should be enough."\nHe gave me a searching glance. There was a tear in the corner of his\neye. He chuckled and opened the door of the improvised oven, reaching\ngingerly with his gloved hand. The yams, some bubbling with syrup, lay on a\nwire rack above glowing coals that leaped to low blue flame when struck by\nthe draft of air. The flash of warmth set my face aglow as he removed one of\nthe yams and shut the door.\n"Here you are, suh," he said, starting to put the yam into a bag.\n"Never mind the bag, I\'m going to eat it. Here . . ."\n"Thanks." He took the dime. "If that ain\'t a sweet one, I\'ll give you\nanother one free of charge."\nI knew that it was sweet before I broke it; bubbles of brown syrup\nhad burst the skin.\n"Go ahead and break it," the old man said. "Break it and I\'ll give\nyou some butter since you gon\' eat it right here. Lots of folks takes \'em\nhome. They got their own butter at home."\nI broke it, seeing the sugary pulp steaming in the cold. "Hold it over\nhere," he said. He took a crock from a rack on the side of the wagon. "Right\nhere."\nI held it, watching him pour a spoonful of melted butter over the\nyam and the butter seeping in. "Thanks."\n"You welcome. And I\'ll tell you something."\n"What\'s that?" I said.\n"If that ain\'t the best eating you had in a long time, I give you your\nmoney back."\n"You don\'t have to convince me," I said. "I can look at it and see it\'s\ngood."\n"You right, but everything what looks good ain\'t necessarily good," he\nsaid. "But these is."\nI took a bite, finding it as sweet and hot as any I\'d ever had, and\nwas overcome with such a surge of homesickness that I turned away to keep\nmy control. I walked along, munching the yam, just as suddenly overcome by\nan intense feeling of freedom -- simply because I was eating while walking\nalong the street. It was exhilarating. I no longer had to worry about who saw\nme or about what was proper. To hell with all that, and as sweet as the yam\nactually was, it became like nectar with the thought. If only someone who\nhad known me at school or at home would come along and see me now.\nHow shocked they\'d be! I\'d push them into a side street and smear their\nfaces with the peel. What a group of people we were, I thought. Why, you\ncould cause us the greatest humiliation simply by confronting us with\nsomething we liked. Not all of us, but so many. Simply by walking up and\nshaking a set of chitterlings or a well-boiled hog maw at them during the\nclear light of day! What consternation it would cause! And I saw myself\nadvancing upon Bledsoe, standing bare of his false humility in the crowded\nlobby of Men\'s House, and seeing him there and him seeing me and ignoring\nme and me enraged and suddenly whipping out a foot or two of chitterlings,\nraw, uncleaned and dripping sticky circles on the floor as I shake them in his\nface, shouting:\n"Bledsoe, you\'re a shameless chitterling eater! I accuse you of\nrelishing how bowels! Ha! And not only do you eat them, you sneak and eat\nthem in private when you think you\'re unobserved! You\'re a sneaking\nchitterling lover! I accuse you of indulging in a filthy habit, Bledsoe! Lug\nthem out of there, Bledsoe! Lug them out so we can see! I accuse you before\nthe eyes of the world!" And he lugs them out, yards of them, with mustard\ngreens, and racks of pigs\' ears, and pork chops and black-eyed peas with dull\naccusing eyes.\nI let out a wild laugh, almost choking over the yam as the scene\nspun before me. Why, with others present, it would be worse than if I had\naccused him of raping an old woman of ninety-nine years, weighing ninety\npounds . . . blind in one eye and lame in the hip! Bledsoe would\ndisintegrate, disinflate! With a profound sigh he\'d drop his head in shame.\nHe\'d lose caste. The weekly newspapers would attack him. The captions over\nhis picture: Prominent Educator Reverts to Field Niggerism! His rivals would\ndenounce him as a bad example for the South. Editorials would demand that\nhe either recant or retire from public life. In the South his white folks would\ndesert him; he would be discussed far and wide, and all of the trustees\'\nmoney couldn\'t prop up his sagging prestige. He\'d end up an exile washing\ndishes at the Automat. For down South he\'d be unable to get a job on the\nhoney wagon.\nThis is all very wild and childish, I thought, but to hell with being\nashamed of what you liked. No more of that for me. I am what I am! I\nwolfed down the yam and ran back to the old man and handed him twenty\ncents, "Give me two more," I said.\n"Sho, all you want, long as I got \'em. I can see you a serious yam\neater, young fellow. You eating them right away?"\n"As soon as you give them to me," I said.\n"You want \'em buttered?"\n"Please."\n"Sho, that way you can get the most out of \'em. Yessuh," he said,\nhanding over the yams, "I can see you one of these old-fashioned yam\neaters."\n"They\'re my birthmark," I said. "I yam what I am!"\n"Then you must be from South Car\'lina," he said with a grin.\n"South Carolina nothing, where I come from we really go for yams."\n"Come back tonight or tomorrow if you can eat some more," he\ncalled after me. "My old lady\'ll be out here with some hot sweet potato fried\npies."\nHot fried pies, I thought sadly, moving away. I would probably have\nindigestion if I ate one -- now that I no longer felt ashamed of the things I\nhad always loved, I probably could no longer digest very many of them. What\nand how much had I lost by trying to do only what was expected of me\ninstead of what I myself had wished to do? What a waste, what a senseless\nwaste! But what of those things which you actually didn\'t like, not because\nyou were not supposed to like them, not because to dislike them was\nconsidered a mark of refinement and education -- but because you actually\nfound them distasteful? The very idea annoyed me. How could you know? It\ninvolved a problem of choice. I would have to weigh many things carefully\nbefore deciding and there would be some things that would cause quite a bit\nof trouble, simply because I had never formed a personal attitude toward so\nmuch. I had accepted the accepted attitudes and it had made life seem simple\n. . .\nBut not yams, I had no problem concerning them and I would eat\nthem whenever and wherever I took the notion. Continue on the yam level\nand life would be sweet -- though somewhat yellowish. Yet the freedom to eat\nyams on the street was far less than I had expected upon coming to the city.\nAn unpleasant taste bloomed in my mouth now as I bit the end of the yam\nand threw it into the street; it had been frost-bitten.\nThe wind drove me into a side street where a group of boys had set\na packing box afire. The gray smoke hung low and seemed to thicken as I\nwalked with my head down and eyes closed, trying to avoid the fumes. My\nlungs began to pain; then emerging, wiping my eyes and coughing, I almost\nstumbled over it: It was piled in a jumble along the walk and over the curb\ninto the street, like a lot of junk waiting to be hauled away. Then I saw the\nsullen-faced crowd, looking at a building where two white men were toting\nout a chair in which an old woman sat; who, as I watched, struck at them\nfeebly with her fists. A motherly-looking old woman with her head tied in a\nhandkerchief, wearing a man\'s shoes and a man\'s heavy blue sweater. It was\nstartling: The crowd watching silently, the two white men lugging the chair\nand trying to dodge the blows and the old woman\'s face streaming with angry\ntears as she thrashed at them with her fists. I couldn\'t believe it. Something,\na sense of foreboding, filled me, a quick sense of uncleanliness.\n"Leave us alone," she cried, "leave us alone!" as the men pulled their\nheads out of range and sat her down abruptly at the curb, hurrying back into\nthe building.\nWhat on earth, I thought, looking about me. What on earth? The old\nwoman sobbed, pointing to the stuff piled along the curb. "Just look what\nthey doing to us. Just look," looking straight at me. And I realized that what\nI\'d taken for junk was actually worn household furnishings.\n"Just look at what they doing," she said, her teary eyes upon my\nface.\nI looked away embarrassed, staring into the rapidly growing crowd.\nFaces were peering sullenly from the windows above. And now as the two\nmen reappeared at the top of the steps carrying a battered chest of drawers,\nI saw a third man come out and stand behind them, pulling at his ear as he\nlooked out over the crowd.\n"Shake it up, you fellows," he said, "shake it up. We don\'t have all\nday."\nThen the men came down with the chest and I saw the crowd give\nway sullenly, the men trudging through, grunting and putting the chest at the\ncurb, then returning into the building without a glance to left or right.\n"Look at that," a slender man near me said. "We ought to beat the\nhell out of those paddies!"\nI looked silently into his face, taut and ashy in the cold, his eyes\ntrained upon the men going up the steps.\n"Sho, we ought to stop \'em," another man said, "but ain\'t that much\nnerve in the whole bunch."\n"There\'s plenty nerve," the slender man said. "All they need is\nsomeone to set it off. All they need is a leader. You mean you don\'t have the\nnerve."\n"Who me?" the man said. "Who me?"\n"Yes, you."\n"Just look," the old woman said, "just look," her face still turned\ntoward mine. I turned away, edging closer to the two men.\n"Who are those men?" I said, edging closer.\n"Marshals or something. I don\'t give a damn who they is."\n"Marshals, hell," another man said. "Those guys doing all the toting\nain\'t nothing but trusties. Soon as they get through they\'ll lock \'em up again."\n"I don\'t care who they are, they got no business putting these old\nfolks out on the sidewalk."\n"You mean they\'re putting them out of their apartment?" I said.\n"They can do that up here?"\n"Man, where you from?" he said, swinging toward me.\n"What does it look like they puttin\' them out of, a Pullman car?\nThey being evicted!"\nI was embarrassed; others were turning to stare. I had never seen an\neviction. Someone snickered.\n"Where did he come from?"\nA flash of heat went over me and J turned. "Look, friends," I said,\nhearing a hot edge coming into my voice. "I asked a civil question. If you\ndon\'t care to answer, don\'t, but don\'t try to make me look ridiculous."\n"Ridiculous? Hell, all scobos is ridiculous. Who the hell is you?"\n"Never mind, I am who I am. Just don\'t beat up your gums at me,"\nI said, throwing him a newly acquired phrase.\nJust then one of the men came down the steps with an armful of\narticles, and I saw the old woman reach up, yelling, "Take your hands off my\nBible!" And the crowd surged forward.\nThe white man\'s hot eyes swept the crowd. "Where, lady?" he said. "I\ndon\'t see any Bible."\nAnd I saw her snatch the Book from his arms, clutching it fiercely\nand sending forth a shriek. "They can come in your home and do what they\nwant to you," she said. "Just come stomping in and jerk your life up by the\nroots! But this here\'s the last straw. They ain\'t going to bother with my\nBible!"\nThe white man eyed the crowd. "Look, lady," he said, more to the\nrest of us than to her, "I don\'t want to do this, I have to do it. They sent\nme up here to do it. If it was left to me, you could stay here till hell freezes\nover . . ."\n"These white folks, Lord. These white folks," she moaned, her eyes\nturned toward the sky, as an old man pushed past me and went to her.\n"Hon, Hon," he said, placing his hand on her shoulder. "It\'s the\nagent, not these gentlemen. He\'s the one; He says it\'s the bank, but you\nknow he\'s the one. We\'ve done business with him for over twenty years."\n"Don\'t tell me," she said. "It\'s all the white folks, not just one. They\nall against us. Every stinking low-down one of them."\n"She\'s right!" a hoarse voice said. "She\'s right! They all is!"\nSomething had been working fiercely inside me, and for a moment I\nhad forgotten the rest of the crowd. Now I recognized a selfconsciousness\nabout them, as though they, we, were ashamed to witness the eviction, as\nthough we were all unwilling intruders upon some shameful event; and thus\nwe were careful not to touch or stare too hard at the effects that lined the\ncurb; for we were witnesses of what we did not wish to see, though curious,\nfascinated, despite our shame, and through it all the old female,\nmind-plunging crying.\nI looked at the old people, feeling my eyes burn, my throat tighten.\nThe old woman\'s sobbing was having a strange effect upon me-as when a\nchild, seeing the tears of its parents, is moved by both fear and sympathy to\ncry. I turned away, feeling myself being drawn to the old couple by a warm,\ndark, rising whirpool of emotion which I feared. I was wary of what the sight\nof them crying there on the sidewalk was making me begin to feel. I wanted\nto leave, but was too ashamed to leave, was rapidly becoming too much a\npart of it to leave.\nI turned aside and looked at the clutter of household objects which\nthe two men continued to pile on the walk. And as the crowd pushed me I\nlooked down to see looking out of an oval frame a portrait of the old couple\nwhen young, seeing the sad, stiff dignity of the faces there; feeling strange\nmemories awakening that began an echoing in my head like that of a\nhysterical voice stuttering in a dark street. Seeing them look back at me as\nthough even then in that nineteenth-century day they had expected little, and\nthis with a grim, unillusioned pride that suddenly seemed to me both a\nreproach and a warning. My eyes fell upon a pair of crudely carved and\npolished bones, "knocking bones," used to accompany music at country\ndances, used in black-face minstrels; the flat ribs of a cow, a steer or sheep,\nflat bones that gave off a sound, when struck, like heavy castanets (had he\nbeen a minstrel?) or the wooden block of a set of drums. Pots and pots of\ngreen plants were lined in the dirty snow, certain to die of the cold; ivy,\ncanna, a tomato plant. And in a basket I saw a straightening comb, switches\nof false hair, a curling iron, a card with silvery letters against a background\nof dark red velvet, reading "God Bless Our Home"; and scattered across the\ntop of a chiffonier were nuggets of High John the Conqueror, the lucky stone;\nand as I watched the white men put down a basket in which I saw a\nwhiskey bottle filled with rock candy and camphor, a small Ethiopian flag, a\nfaded tintype of Abraham Lincoln, and the smiling image of a Hollywood star\ntorn from a magazine. And on a pillow several badly cracked pieces of\ndelicate china, a commemorative plate celebrating the St. Louis World Fair . .\n. I stood in a kind of daze, looking at an old folded lace fan studded with jet\nand mother-of-pearl.\nThe crowd surged as the white men came back, knocking over a\ndrawer that spilled its contents in the snow at my feet. I stooped and starting\nreplacing the articles: a bent Masonic emblem, a set of tarnished cuff links,\nthree brass rings, a dime pierced with a nail hole so as to be worn about the\nankle on a string for luck, an ornate greeting card with the message\n"Grandma, I love you" in childish scrawl; another card with a picture of what\nlooked like a white man in black-face seated in the door of a cabin\nstrumming a banjo beneath a bar of music and the lyric "Going back to my\nold cabin home"; a useless inhalant, a string of bright glass beads with a\ntarnished clasp, a rabbit foot, a celluloid baseball scoring card shaped like a\ncatcher\'s mitt, registering a game won or lost years ago; an old breast pump\nwith rubber bulb yellowed with age, a worn baby shoe and a dusty lock of\ninfant hair tied with a faded and crumpled blue ribbon. I felt nauseated. In\nmy hand I held three lapsed life insurance policies with perforated seals\nstamped "Void"; a yellowing newspaper portrait of a huge black man with the\ncaption: MARCUS GARVEY DEPORTED.\nI turned away, bending and searching the dirty snow for anything\nmissed by my eyes, and my fingers closed upon something resting in a frozen\nfootstep: a fragile paper, coming apart with age, written in black ink grown\nyellow. I read: FREE PAPERS. Be it known to all men that my negro, Primus\nProvo, has been freed by me this sixth day of August, 1859. Signed: John\nSamuels Macon . . . I folded it quickly, blotting out the single drop of melted\nsnow which glistened on the yellowed page, and dropped it back into the\ndrawer. My hands were trembling, my breath rasping as if I had run a long\ndistance or come upon a coiled snake in a busy street. It has been longer\nthan that, further removed in time, I told myself, and yet I knew that it\nhadn\'t been. I replaced the drawer in the chest and pushed drunkenly to the\ncurb.\nBut it wouldn\'t come up, only a bitter spurt of gall filled my mouth\nand splattered the old folk\'s possessions. I turned and stared again at the\njumble, no longer looking at what was before my eyes, but\ninwardly-outwardly, around a corner into the dark, far-away-and-long-ago, not\nso much of my own memory as of remembered words, of linked verbal\nechoes, images, heard even when not listening at home. And it was as though\nI myself was being dispossessed of some painful yet precious thing which I\ncould not bear to lose; something confounding, like a rotted tooth that one\nwould rather suffer indefinitely than endure the short, violent eruption of pain\nthat would mark its removal. And with this sense of dispossession came a\npang of vague recognition: this junk, these shabby chairs, these heavy,\nold-fashioned pressing irons, zinc wash tubs with dented bottoms -- all\nthrobbed within me with more meaning than there should have been: And\nwhy did I, standing in the crowd, see like a vision my mother hanging wash\non a cold windy day, so cold that the warm clothes froze even before the\nvapor thinned and hung stiff on the line, and her hands white and raw in\nthe skirt-swirling wind and her gray head bare to the darkened sky -- why\nwere they causing me discomfort so far beyond their intrinsic meaning as\nobjects? And why did I see them now as behind a veil that threatened to lift,\nstirred by the cold wind in the narrow street?\nA scream, "I\'m going in!" spun me around. The old couple were on\nthe steps now, the old man holding her arm, the white men leaning forward\nabove, and the crowd pressing me closer to the steps.\n"You can\'t go in, lady," the man said.\n"I want to pray!" she said.\n"I can\'t help it, lady. You\'ll have to do your praying out here."\n"I\'m go\'n in!"\n"Not in here!"\n"All we want to do is go in and pray," she said, clutching her Bible.\n"It ain\'t right to pray in the street like this."\n"I\'m sorry," he said.\n"Aw, let the woman go in to pray," a voice called from the crowd.\n"You got all their stuff out here on the walk -- what more do you want,\nblood?"\n"Sure, let them old folks pray."\n"That\'s what\'s wrong with us now, all this damn praying," another\nvoice called.\n"You don\'t go back, see," the white man said. "You were legally\nevicted."\n"But all we want to do is go in an\' kneel on the floor," the old man\nsaid. "We been living right here for over twenty years. I don\'t see why you\ncan\'t let us go just for a few minutes . . ."\n"Look, I\'ve told you," the man said. "I\'ve got my orders. You\'re\nwasting my time."\n"We\'re go\'n in!" the woman said.\nIt happened so suddenly that I could barely keep up with it: I saw\nthe old woman clutching her Bible and rushing up the steps, her husband\nbehind her and the white man stepping in front of them and stretching out\nhis arm. "I\'ll jug you," he yelled, "by God, I\'ll jug you!"\n"Take your hands off that woman!" someone called from the crowd.\nThen at the top of the stairs they were pushing against the man and\nI saw the old woman fall backwards, and the crowd exploded.\n"Get that paddie sonofabitch!"\n"He struck her!" a West Indian woman screamed into my ear. "The\nfilthy brute, he struck her!"\n"Stand back or I\'ll shoot," the man called, his eyes wild as he drew a\ngun and backed into the doorway where the two trusties stood bewildered,\ntheir arms full of articles. "I swear I\'ll shoot! You don\'t know what you\'re\ndoing, but I\'ll shoot!"\nThey hesitated. "Ain\'t but six bullets in that thing," a little fellow\ncalled. "Then what you going to do?"\n"Yeah, you damn sho caint hide."\n"I advise you to stay out of this," the marshal called.\n"Think you can come up here and hit one of our women, you a\nfool."\n"To hell with all this talk, let\'s rush that bastard!"\n"You better think twice," the white man called.\nI saw them start up the steps and felt suddenly as though my head\nwould split. I knew that they were about to attack the man and I was both\nafraid and angry, repelled and fascinated. I both wanted it and feared the\nconsequences, was outraged and angered at what I saw and yet surged with\nfear; not for the man or of the consequences of an attack, but of what the\nsight of violence might release in me. And beneath it all there boiled up all\nthe shock-absorbing phrases that I had learned all my life. I seemed to totter\non the edge of a great dark hole.\n"No, no," I heard myself yelling. "Black men! Brothers! Black\nBrothers! That\'s not the way. We\'re law-abiding. We\'re a law-abiding people\nand a slow-to-anger people."\nForcing my way quickly through the crowd, I stood on the steps\nfacing those in front, talking rapidly without thought but out of my clashing\nemotions. "We\'re a law-abiding people and a slow-to-anger people . . ." They\nstopped, listening. Even the white man was startled.\n"Yeah, but we mad now," a voice called out.\n"Yes, you\'re right," I called back. "We\'re angry, but let us be wise.\nLet us, I mean let us not . . . Let us learn from that great leader whose wise\naction was reported in the newspaper the other day . . ."\n"What, mahn? Who?" a West Indian voice shouted.\n"Come on! To hell with this guy, let\'s get that paddie before they\nsend him some help . . ."\n"No, wait," I yelled. "Let\'s follow a leader, let\'s organize. Organize.\nWe need someone like that wise leader, you read about him, down in\nAlabama. He was strong enough to choose to do the wise thing in spite of\nwhat he felt himself . . ."\n"Who, mahn? Who?"\nThis was it, I thought, they\'re listening, eager to listen.\nNobody laughed. If they laugh, I\'ll die! I tensed my diaphragm.\n"That wise man," I said, "you read about him, who when that fugitive\nescaped from the mob and ran to his school for protection, that wise man\nwho was strong enough to do the legal thing, the law-abiding thing, to turn\nhim over to the forces of law and order . . ."\n"Yeah," a voice rang out, "yeah, so they could lynch his ass."\nOh, God, this wasn\'t it at all. Poor technique and not at all what I\nintended.\n"He was a wise leader," I yelled. "He was within the law. Now wasn\'t\nthat the wise thing to do?"\n"Yeah, he was wise all right," the man laughed angrily. "Now get out\nof the way so we can jump this paddie."\nThe crowd yelled and I laughed in response as though hypnotized.\n"But wasn\'t that the human thing to do? After all, he had to protect\nhimself because --"\n"He was a handkerchief-headed rat!" a woman screamed, her voice\nboiling with contempt.\n"Yes, you\'re right. He was wise and cowardly, but what about us?\nWhat are we to do?" I yelled, suddenly thrilled by the response. "Look at\nhim," I cried.\n"Yes, just look at him!" an old fellow in a derby called out as though\nanswering a preacher in church.\n"And look at that old couple . . ."\n"Yeah, what about Sister and Brother Provo?" he said. "It\'s an\nungodly shame!"\n"And look at their possessions all strewn there on the sidewalk. Just\nlook at their possessions in the snow. How old are you, sir?" I yelled.\n"I\'m eighty-seven," the old man said, his voice low and bewildered.\n"How\'s that? Yell so our slow-to-anger brethren can hear you."\n"I\'m eighty-seven years old!"\n"Did you hear him? He\'s eighty-seven. Eighty-seven and look at all\nhe\'s accumulated in eighty-seven years, strewn in the snow like chicken guts,\nand we\'re a law-abiding, slow-to-anger bunch of folks turning the other cheek\nevery day in the week. What are we going to do? What would you, what\nwould I, what would he have done? What is to be done? I propose we do\nthe wise thing, the law-abiding thing. Just look at this junk! Should two old\nfolks live in such junk, cooped up in a filthy room? It\'s a great danger, a fire\nhazard! Old cracked dishes and broken-down chairs. Yes, yes, yes! Look at\nthat old woman, somebody\'s mother, somebody\'s grandmother, maybe. We call\nthem \'Big Mama\' and they spoil us and -- you know, you remember . . .\nLook at her quilts and broken-down shoes. I know she\'s somebody\'s mother\nbecause I saw an old breast pump fall into the snow, and she\'s somebody\'s\ngrandmother, because I saw a card that read \'Dear Grandma\' . . . But we\'re\nlaw-abiding . . . I looked into a basket and I saw some bones, not neckbones,\nbut rib bones, knocking bones . . . This old couple used to dance . . . I saw\n-- What kind of work do you do, Father?" I called.\n"I\'m a day laborer . . ."\n". . . A day laborer, you heard him, but look at his stuff strewn like\nchitterlings in the snow . . . Where has all his labor gone? Is he lying?"\n"Hell, no, he ain\'t lying."\n"Naw, suh!"\n"Then where did his labor go? Look at his old blues records and her\npots of plants, they\'re down-home folks, and everything tossed out like junk\nwhirled eighty-seven years in a cyclone. Eighty-seven years, and poof! like a\nsnort in a windstorm. Look at them, they look like my mama and papa and\nmy grandma and grandpa, and I look like you and you look like me. Look at\nthem but remember that we\'re a wise, law-abiding group of people. And\nremember it when you look up there in the doorway at that law standing\nthere with his forty-five. Look at him, standing with his blue steel pistol and\nhis blue serge suit. Look at him! You don\'t see just one man dressed in one\nblue serge suit, or one forty-five, you see ten for every one of us, ten guns\nand ten warm suits and ten fat bellies and ten million laws. Laws, that\'s what\nwe call them down South! Laws! And we\'re wise, and law-abiding. And look\nat this old woman with her dog-eared Bible. What\'s she trying to bring off\nhere? She\'s let her religion go to her head, but we all know that religion is\nfor the heart, not for the head. \'Blessed are the pure in heart,\' it says.\nNothing about the poor in head. What\'s she trying to do? What about the\nclear of head? And the clear of eye, the ice-water-visioned who see too clear\nto miss a lie? Look out there at her cabinet with its gaping drawers.\nEighty-seven years to fill them, and full of brick and brack, a bric-a-brac, and\nshe wants to break the law . . . What\'s happened to them? They\'re our\npeople, your people and mine, your parents and mine. What\'s happened to\n\'em?"\n"I\'ll tell you!" a heavyweight yelled, pushing out of the crowd, his\nface angry. "Hell, they been dispossessed, you crazy sonofabitch, get out the\nway!"\n"Dispossessed?" I cried, holding up my hand and allowing the word\nto whistle from my throat. "That\'s a good word, \'Dispossessed\'! \'Dispossessed,\'\neighty-seven years and dispossessed of what? They ain\'t got nothing, they\ncaint get nothing, they never had nothing. So who was dispossessed?" I\ngrowled. "We\'re law-abiding. So who\'s being dispossessed? Can it be us?\nThese old ones are out in the snow, but we\'re here with them. Look at their\nstuff, not a pit to hiss in, nor a window to shout the news and us right with\nthem. Look at them, not a shack to pray in or an alley to sing the blues!\nThey\'re facing a gun and we\'re facing it with them. They don\'t want the\nworld, but only Jesus. They only want Jesus, just fifteen minutes of Jesus on\nthe rug-bare floor . . . How about it, Mr. Law? Do we get our fifteen minutes\nworth of Jesus? You got the world, can we have our Jesus?"\n"I got my orders, Mac," the man called, waving the pistol with a\nsneer. "You\'re doing all right, tell \'em to keep out of this. This is legal and\nI\'ll shoot if I have to . . ."\n"But what about the prayer?"\n"They don\'t go back!"\n"Are you positive?"\n"You could bet your life," he said.\n"Look at him," I called to the angry crowd. "With his blue steel\npistol and his blue serge suit. You heard him, he\'s the law. He says he\'ll\nshoot us down because we\'re a law-abiding people. So we\'ve been\ndispossessed, and what\'s more, he thinks he\'s God. Look up there backed\nagainst the post with a criminal on either side of him. Can\'t you feel the cold\nwind, can\'t you hear it asking, \'What did you do with your heavy labor?\nWhat did you do?\' When you look at all you haven\'t got in eighty-seven years\nyou feel ashamed --"\n"Tell \'em about it, brother," an old man interrupted. "It makes you\nfeel you ain\'t a man."\n"Yes, these old folks had a dream book, but the pages went blank\nand it failed to give them the number. It was called the Seeing Eye, The\nGreat Constitutional Dream Book, The Secrets of Africa, The Wisdom of Egypt\n-- but the eye was blind, it lost its luster. It\'s all cataracted like a cross-eyed\ncarpenter and it doesn\'t saw straight. All we have is the Bible and this Law\nhere rules that out. So where do we go? Where do we go from here, without\na pot --"\n"We going after that paddie," the heavyweight called, rushing up the\nsteps.\nSomeone pushed me. "No, wait," I called.\n"Get out the way now."\nThere was a rush against me and I fell, hearing a single explosion,\nbackward into a whirl of milling legs, overshoes, the trampled snow cold on\nmy hands. Another shot sounded above like a bursting bag. Managing to\nstand, I saw atop the steps the fist with the gun being forced into the air\nabove the crowd\'s bobbing heads and the next instant they were dragging him\ndown into the snow; punching him left and right, uttering a low tense\nswelling sound of desperate effort; a grunt that exploded into a thousand\nsoftly spat, hate-sizzling curses. I saw a woman striking with the pointed heel\nof her shoe, her face a blank mask with hollow black eyes as she aimed and\nstruck, aimed and struck, bringing spurts of blood, running along beside the\nman who was dragged to his feet now as they punched him gauntlet-wise\nbetween them. Suddenly I saw a pair of handcuffs arc gleaming into the air\nand sail across the street. A boy broke out of the crowd, the marshal\'s\nsnappy hat on his head. The marshal was spun this way and that, then a\nswift tattoo of blows started him down the street. I was beside myself with\nexcitement. The crowd surged after him, milling like a huge man trying to\nturn in a cubbyhole -- some of them laughing, some cursing, some intently\nsilent.\n"The brute struck that gentle woman, poor thing!" the West Indian\nwoman chanted. "Black men, did you ever see such a brute? Is he a\ngentleman, I ask you? The brute! Give it back to him, black men. Repay the\nbrute a thousandfold! Give it back to him unto the third and fourth\ngenerations. Strike him, our fine black men. Protect your black women! Repay\nthe arrogant creature to the third and fourth generations!"\n"We\'re dispossessed," I sang at the top of my voice, "dispossessed\nand we want to pray. Let\'s go in and pray. Let\'s have a big prayer meeting.\nBut we\'ll need some chairs to sit in . . . rest upon as we kneel. We\'ll need\nsome chairs!"\n"Here\'s some chairs down here," a woman called from the walk.\n"How \'bout taking in some chairs?"\n"Sure," I called, "take everything. Take it all, hide that junk! Put it\nback where it came from. It\'s blocking the street and the sidewalk, and that\'s\nagainst the law. We\'re law-abiding, so clear the street of the debris. Put it out\nof sight! Hide it, hide their shame! Hide our shame!\n"Come on, men," I yelled, dashing down the steps and seizing a chair\nand starting back, no longer struggling against or thinking about the nature of\nmy action. The others followed, picking up pieces of furniture and lugging\nthem back into the building.\n"We ought to done this long ago," a man said.\n"We damn sho should."\n"I feel so good," a woman said, "I feel so good!"\n"Black men, I\'m proud of you," the West Indian woman shrilled.\n"Proud!"\nWe rushed into the dark little apartment that smelled of stale\ncabbage and put the pieces down and returned for more. Men, women and\nchildren seized articles and dashed inside shouting, laughing. I looked for the\ntwo trusties, but they seemed to have disappeared. Then, coming down into\nthe street, I thought I saw one. He was carrying a chair back inside.\n"So you\'re law-abiding too," I called only to become aware that it\nwas someone else. A white man but someone else altogether.\nThe man laughed at me and continued inside. And when I reached\nthe street there were several of them, men and women, standing about,\ncheering whenever another piece of furniture was returned. It was like a\nholiday. I didn\'t want it to stop.\n"Who are those people?" I called from the steps.\n"What people?" someone called back.\n"Those," I said, pointing.\n"You mean those ofays?"\n"Yes, what do they want?"\n"We\'re friends of the people," one of the white men called.\n"Friends of what people?" I called, prepared to jump down upon him\nif he answered, "You people."\n"We\'re friends of all the common people," he shouted. "We came up\nto help."\n"We believe in brotherhood," another called.\n"Well, pick up that sofa and come on," I called. I was uneasy about\ntheir presence and disappointed when they all joined the crowd and started\nlugging the evicted articles back inside. Where had I heard of them?\n"Why don\'t we stage a march?" one of the white men called, going\npast.\n"Why don\'t we march!" I yelled out to the sidewalk before I had\ntime to think.\nThey took it up immediately.\n"Let\'s march . . ."\n"It\'s a good idea."\n"Let\'s have a demonstration . . ."\n"Let\'s parade!"\nI heard the siren and saw the scout cars swing into the block in the\nsame instant. It was the police! I looked into the crowd, trying to focus upon\ntheir faces, hearing someone yell, "Here come the cops," and others\nanswering, "Let \'em come!"\nWhere is all this leading? I thought, seeing a white man run inside\nthe building as the policemen dashed from their cars and came running up.\n"What\'s going on here?" a gold-shield officer called up the steps.\nIt had become silent. No one answered.\n"I said, what\'s going on here," he repeated. "You," he called, pointing\nstraight at me.\n"We\'ve . . . we\'ve been clearing the sidewalk of a lot of junk," I\ncalled, tense inside.\n"What\'s that?" he said.\n"It\'s a clean-up campaign," I called, wanting to laugh. "These old\nfolks had all their stuff cluttering up the sidewalk and we cleared the street .\n. ."\n"You mean you\'re interfering with an eviction," he called, starting\nthrough the crowd.\n"He ain\'t doing nothing," a woman called from behind me.\nI looked around, the steps behind were filled with those who had\nbeen inside.\n"We\'re all together," someone called, as the crowd closed in.\n"Clear the streets," the officer ordered.\n"That\'s what we were doing," someone called from back in the crowd.\n"Mahoney!" he bellowed to another policeman, "send in a riot call!"\n"What riot?" one of the white men called to him. "There\'s no riot."\n"If I say there\'s a riot, there\'s a riot," the officer said. "And what are\nyou white people doing up here in Harlem?"\n"We\'re citizens. We go anywhere we like."\n"Listen! Here come some more cops!" someone called.\n"Let them come!"\n"Let the Commissioner come!"\nIt became too much for me. The whole thing had gotten out of hand.\nWhat had I said to bring on all this? I edged to the back of the crowd on\nthe steps and backed into the hallway. Where would I go? I hurried up to\nthe old couple\'s apartment. But I can\'t hide here, I thought, heading back for\nthe stairs.\n"No. You can\'t go that way," a voice said.\nI whirled. It was a white girl standing in the door.\n"What are you doing in here?" I shouted, my fear turning to feverish\nanger.\n"I didn\'t mean to startle you," she said. "Brother, that was quite a\nspeech you made. I heard just the end of it, but you certainly moved them to\naction . . ."\n"Action," I said, "action --"\n"Don\'t be modest, brother," she said, "I heard you."\n"Look, Miss, we\'d better get out of here," I said, finally controlling\nthe throbbing in my throat. "There are a lot of policemen downstairs and\nmore coming."\n"Oh, yes. You\'d better go over the roof," she said. "Otherwise,\nsomeone is sure to point you out."\n"Over the roof?"\n"It\'s easy. Just go up to the roof of the building and keep crossing\nuntil you reach the house at the end of the block. Then open the door and\nwalk down as though you\'ve been visiting. You\'d better hurry. The longer you\nremain unknown to the police, the longer you\'ll be effective."\nEffective? I thought. What did she mean? And what was this\n"brother" business?\n"Thanks," I said, and hurried for the stairs.\n"Good-bye," her voice rose fluidly behind me. I turned, glimpsing her\nwhite face in the dim light of the darkened doorway.\nI took the flight in a bound and cautiously opened the door, and\nsuddenly the sun flared on the roof and it was windy cold. Before me the\nlow, snow-caked walls dividing the buildings stretched hurdle-like the long\nlength of the block to the corner, and before me empty clotheslines trembled\nin the wind. I made my way through the wind-carved snow to the next roof\nand then to the next, going with swift caution. Planes were rising over an\nairfield far to the southeast, and I was running now and seeing all the church\nsteeples rising and falling and stacks with smoke leaning sharp against the\nsky, and below in the street the sound of sirens and shouting. I hurried.\nThen, climbing over a wall I looked back, seeing a man hurrying after me,\nslipping, sliding, going over the low dividing walls of the roofs with puffing,\nbustling effort. I turned and ran, trying to put the rows of chimneys between\nus, wondering why he didn\'t yell "Halt!" or shout, or shoot. I ran, dodging\nbehind an elevator housing, then dashing to the next roof, going down, the\nsnow cold to my hands, knees striking, toes gripping, and up and running\nand looking back, seeing the short figure in black still running after. The\ncorner seemed a mile away. I tried to count the number of roofs that\nbounced before me yet to be crossed. Getting to seven, I ran, hearing shouts,\nmore sirens, and looking back and him still behind me, running in a\nshort-legged scramble, still behind me as I tried to open the door of a\nbuilding to go down and finding it stuck and running once more, trying to\nzig-zag in the snow and feeling the crunch of gravel underneath, and behind\nme still, as I swung over a partition and went brushing past a huge cote and\narousing a flight of frantic white birds, suddenly as large as buzzards as they\nbeat furiously against my eyes, dazzling the sun as they fluttered up and away\nand around in a furious glide and me running again and looking back and\nfor a split second thinking him gone and once more seeing him bobbing\nafter. Why doesn\'t he shoot? Why? If only it were like at home where I knew\nsomeone in all the houses, knew them by sight and by name, by blood and\nby background, by shame and pride, and by religion.\nIt was a carpeted hall and I moved down with pounding heart as a\ndog set up a terrific din within the top apartment. Then I moved quickly, my\nbody like glass inside as I skipped downward off the edges of the stairs.\nLooking down the stairwell I saw pale light filtering through the door glass,\nfar below. But what had happened to the girl, had she put the man on my\ntrail? What was she doing there? I bounded down, no one challenging me,\nand I stopped in the vestibule, breathing deeply and listening for his hand\nupon the door above and brushing my clothing into order. Then I stepped\ninto the street with a nonchalance copied from characters I had seen in the\nmovies. No sound from above, not even the malicious note of the barking\ndog.\nIt was a long block and I had come down into a building that faced\nnot the street but the avenue. A squad of mounted policemen lashed\nthemselves around the corner and galloped past, the horseshoes thudding\ndully through the snow, the men rising high in their saddles, shouting. I\npicked up speed, careful not to run, heading away. This was awful. What on\nearth had I said to have brought on all this? How would it end? Someone\nmight be killed. Heads would be pistol-whipped. I stopped at the corner,\nlooking for the pursuing man, the detective, and for a bus. The long white\nstretch of street was empty, the aroused pigeons still circling overhead. I\nscanned the roofs, expecting to see him peering down. The sound of shouting\ncontinued to rise, then another green and white patrol car was whining\naround the corner and speeding past me, heading for the block. I cut through\na block in which there were close to a dozen funeral parlors, each decked out\nwith neon signs, all set up in old brownstone buildings. Elaborate funeral cars\nstood along the curb, one a dull black with windows shaped like Gothic\narches, through which I saw funeral flowers piled upon a casket. I hurried on.\nI could see the girl\'s face still, below the short flight of stairs. But\nwho was the figure that had crossed the roof behind me? Chased me? Why\nhad he been so silent, and why was there only one? Yes, and why hadn\'t\nthey sent a patrol car to pick me up? I hurried out of the block of funeral\nparlors into the bright sun that swept the snow of the avenue, slowing to a\nleisurely walk now, trying to give the impression of a complete lack of haste.\nI longed to look stupid, utterly incapable of thought or speech, and tried to\nshuffle my feet over the walk, but quit with distaste after stealing a glance\nbehind me. Just ahead I saw a car pull up and a man leap out with a\nphysician\'s bag.\n"Hurry, Doctor," a man called from the stoop, "she\'s already in\nlabor!"\n"Good," the doctor called. "That\'s what we\'ve been waiting for, isn\'t\nit?"\n"Yeah, but it didn\'t start when we expected it."\nI watched them disappear inside the hall. What a hell of a time to\nbe born, I thought. At the corner I joined several people waiting for the\nlights to change. I had just about convinced myself that I had escaped\nsuccessfully when a quiet, penetrating voice beside me said, "That was a\nmasterful bit of persuasion, brother."\nSuddenly wound tight as a tensioned spring I turned almost\nlethargically. A short insignificant-looking bushy-eyebrowed man, with a quiet\nsmile on his face stood beside me, looking not at all like a policeman.\n"What do you mean?" I asked, my voice lazy, distant.\n"Don\'t be alarmed," he said, "I\'m a friend."\n"I\'ve got nothing to be alarmed about, and you\'re no friend of mine."\n"Then say that I\'m an admirer," he said pleasantly.\n"Admirer of what?"\n"Of your speech," he said. "I was listening."\n"What speech? I made no speech," I said.\nHe smiled knowingly. "I can see that you have been well trained.\nCome, it isn\'t good for you to be seen with me in the street. Let\'s go\nsomewhere for a cup of coffee."\nSomething told me to refuse, but I was intrigued and, underneath it\nall, was probably flattered. Besides, if I refused to go, it would be taken as\nan admission of guilt. And he didn\'t look like a policeman or a detective. I\nwent silently beside him to a cafeteria down near the end of the block, seeing\nhim peer inside through the window before we entered.\n"You get the table, brother. Over there near the wall where we can\ntalk in peace. I\'ll get the coffee."\nI watched him going across the floor with a bouncy, rolling step,\nthen found a table and sat watching him. It was warm in the cafeteria. It\nwas late afternoon now only a few customers were scattered at the tables. I\nwatched the man going familiarly to the food counter and ordering. His\nmovements, as he peered through the brightly lighted shelves of pastry, were\nthose of a lively small animal, a fyce, interested in detecting only the target\ncut of cake. So he\'s heard my speech; well, I\'ll hear what he has to say, I\nthought, seeing him start toward me with his rapid, rolling, bouncy,\nheel-and-toey step. It was as though he had taught himself to walk that way\nand I had a feeling that somehow he was acting a part; that something about\nhim wasn\'t exactly real -- an idea which I dismissed immediately, since there\nwas a quality of unreality over the whole afternoon. He came straight to the\ntable without having to look about for me, as though he had expected me to\ntake that particular table and no other -- although many tables were vacant.\nHe was balancing a plate of cake on top of each cup, setting them down\ndeftly and shoving one toward me as he took his chair.\n"I thought you might like a piece of cheese cake," he said.\n"Cheese cake?" I said. "I\'ve never heard of it."\n"It\'s nice. Sugar?"\n"Go ahead," I said.\n"No, after you, brother."\nI looked at him, then poured three spoonfuls and shoved the shaker\ntoward him. I was tense again.\n"Thanks," I said, repressing an impulse to call him down about the\n"brother" business.\nHe smiled, cutting into his cheese cake with a fork and shoving far\ntoo large a piece into his mouth. His manners are extremely crude, I thought,\ntrying to put him at a disadvantage in my own mind by pointedly taking a\nsmall piece of the cheesy stuff and placing it neatly into my mouth.\n"You know," he said, taking a gulp of coffee, "I haven\'t heard such\nan effective piece of eloquence since the days when I was in -- well, in a\nlong time. You aroused them so quickly to action. I don\'t understand how\nyou managed it. If only some of our speakers could have listened! With a few\nwords you had them involved in action! Others would have still been wasting\ntime with empty verbiage. I want to thank you for a most instructive\nexperience!"\nI drank my coffee silently. Not only did I distrust him, I didn\'t know\nhow much I could safely say.\n"The cheese cake here is good," he said before I could answer. "It\'s\nreally very good. By the way, where did you learn to speak?"\n"Nowhere," I said, much too quickly.\n"Then you\'re very talented. You are a natural. It\'s hard to believe."\n"I was simply angry," I said, deciding to admit this much in order to\nsee what he would reveal.\n"Then your anger was skillfully controlled. It had eloquence. Why was\nthat?"\n"Why? I suppose I felt sorry -- I don\'t know. Maybe I just felt like\nmaking a speech. There was the crowd waiting, so I said a few words. You\nmight not believe it, but I didn\'t know what I was going to say . . ."\n"Please," he said, with a knowing smile.\n"What do you mean?" I said.\n"You try to sound cynical, but I see through you. I know, I listened\nvery carefully to what you had to say. You were enormously moved. Your\nemotions were touched."\n"I guess so," I said. "Maybe seeing them reminded me of something."\nHe leaned forward, watching me intensely now, the smile still on his\nlips.\n"Did it remind you of people you know?"\n"I guess it did," I said.\n"I think I understand. You were watching a death --"\nI dropped my fork. "No one was killed," I said tensely. "What are\nyou trying to do?"\n"A Death on the City Pavements -- that\'s the title of a detective story\nor something I read somewhere . . ." He laughed. "I only mean\nmeta-phor-ically speaking. They\'re living, but dead. Dead-in-living . . . a unity\nof opposites."\n"Oh," I said. What kind of double talk was this?\n"The old ones, they\'re agrarian types, you know. Being ground up by\nindustrial conditions. Thrown on the dump heaps and cast aside. You pointed\nit out very well. \'Eighty-seven years and nothing to show for it,\' you said. You\nwere absolutely correct."\n"I suppose that seeing them like that made me feel pretty bad," I\nsaid.\n"Yes, of course. And you made an effective speech. But you musn\'t\nwaste your emotions on individuals, they don\'t count."\n"Who doesn\'t count?" I said.\n"Those old ones," he said grimly. "It\'s sad, yes. But they\'re already\ndead, defunct. History has passed them by. Unfortunate, but there\'s nothing\nto do about them. They\'re like dead limbs that must be pruned away so that\nthe tree may bear young fruit or the storms of history will blow them down\nanyway. Better the storm should hit them --"\n"But look --"\n"No, let me continue. These people are old. Men grow old and types\nof men grow old. And these are very old. All they have left is their religion.\nThat\'s all they can think about. So they\'ll be cast aside. They\'re dead, you\nsee, because they\'re incapable of rising to the necessity of the historical\nsituation."\n"But I like them," I said. "I like them, they reminded me of folks I\nknow down South. It\'s taken me a long time to feel it, but they\'re folks just\nlike me, except that I\'ve been to school a few years."\nHe wagged his round red head. "Oh, no, brother; you\'re mistaken\nand you\'re sentimental. You\'re not like them. Perhaps you were, but you\'re\nnot any longer. Otherwise you\'d never have made that speech. Perhaps you\nwere, but that\'s all past, dead. You might not recognize it just now, but that\npart of you is dead! You have not completely shed that self, that old agrarian\nself, but it\'s dead and you will throw it off completely and emerge something\nnew. History has been born in your brain."\n"Look," I said, "I don\'t know what you\'re talking about. I\'ve never\nlived on a farm and I didn\'t study agriculture, but I do know why I made\nthat speech."\n"Then why?"\n"Because I was upset over seeing those old folks put out in the\nstreet, that\'s why. I don\'t care what you call it, I was angry."\nHe shrugged. "Let\'s not argue about it," he said. "I\'ve a notion you\ncould do it again. Perhaps you would be interested in working for us."\n"For whom?" I asked, suddenly excited. What was he trying to do?\n"With our organization. We need a good speaker for this district.\nSomeone who can articulate the grievances of the people," he said.\n"But nobody cares about their grievances," I said. "Suppose they were\narticulated, who would listen or care?"\n"They exist," he said with his knowing smile. "They exist, and when\nthe cry of protest is sounded, there are those who will hear it and act."\nThere was something mysterious and smug in the way he spoke, as\nthough he had everything figured out -- whatever he was talking about. Look\nat this very most certain white man, I thought. He didn\'t even realize that I\nwas afraid and yet he speaks so confidently. I got to my feet, "I\'m sorry," I\nsaid, "I have a job and I\'m not interested in anyone\'s grievances but my own\n. . ."\n"But you were concerned with that old couple," he said with\nnarrowed eyes. "Are they relatives of yours?"\n"Sure, we\'re all black," I said, beginning to laugh.\nHe smiled, his eyes intense upon my face.\n"Seriously, are they your relatives?"\n"Sure, we were burned in the same oven," I said.\nThe effect was electric. "Why do you fellows always talk in terms of\nrace!" he snapped, his eyes blazing.\n"What other terms do you know?" I said, puzzled. "You think I\nwould have been around there if they had been white?"\nHe threw up his hands and laughed. "Let\'s not argue that now," he\nsaid. "You were very effective in helping them. I can\'t believe that you\'re such\nan individualist as you pretend. You appeared to be a man who knew his\nduty toward the people and performed it well. Whatever you think about it\npersonally, you were a spokesman for your people and you have a duty to\nwork in their interest."\nHe was too complicated for me. "Look, my friend, thanks for the\ncoffee and cake. I have no more interest in those old folks than in your job.\nI wanted to make a speech. I like to make speeches. What happened\nafterwards is a mystery to me. You picked the wrong man. You should have\nstopped one of those fellows who started yelling at the policemen . . ." I\nstood up.\n"Wait a second," he said, producing a piece of envelope and\nscribbling something. "You might change your mind. As for those others, I\nknow them already."\nI looked at the white paper in his extended hand.\n"You are wise to distrust me," he said. "You don\'t know who I am\nand you don\'t trust me. That\'s as it should be. But I don\'t give up hope,\nbecause some day you will look me up on your own accord and it will be\ndifferent, for then you\'ll be ready. Just call this number and ask for Brother\nJack. You needn\'t give me your name, just mention our conversation. Should\nyou decide tonight, give me a ring about eight."\n"Okay," I said, taking the paper. "I doubt if I\'ll ever need it, but who\nknows?"\n"Well, you think about it, brother. Times are grave and you seem\nvery indignant."\n"I only wanted to make a speech," I said again.\n"But you were indignant. And sometimes the difference between\nindividual and organized indignation is the difference between criminal and\npolitical action," he said.\nI laughed, "So what? I\'m neither a criminal nor a politician, brother.\nSo you picked the wrong man. But thanks again for the coffee and cheese\ncake -- brother."\nI left him sitting with a quiet smile on his face. When I had crossed\nthe avenue I looked through the glass, seeing him still there, and it occurred\nto me that he was the same man who had followed me over the roof. He\nhadn\'t been chasing me at all but only going in the same direction. I hadn\'t\nunderstood much of what he had said, only that he had spoken with great\nconfidence. Anyway, I had been the better runner. Perhaps it was a trick of\nsome kind. He gave the impression that he understood much and spoke out\nof a knowledge far deeper than appeared on the surface of his words.\nPerhaps it was only the knowledge that he had escaped by the same route as\nI. But what had he to fear? I had made the speech, not he. That girl in the\napartment had said that the longer I remained unseen the longer I\'d be\neffective, which didn\'t make much sense either. But perhaps that was why he\nhad run. He wanted to remain unseen and effective. Effective at what? No\ndoubt he was laughing at me. I must have looked silly hurtling across the\nroofs, and like a black-face comedian shrinking from a ghost when the white\npigeons shot up around me. To hell with him. He needn\'t be so smug, I\nknew of some things he didn\'t know. Let him find someone else. He only\nwanted to use me for something. Everybody wanted to use you for some\npurpose. Why should he want me as a speaker? Let him make his own\nspeeches. I headed for home, feeling a growing satisfaction that I had\ndismissed him so completely.\nIt was turning dark now, and much colder. Colder than I had ever\nknown. What on earth was it, I mused, bending my head to the wind, that\nmade us leave the warm, mild weather of home for all this cold, and never\nto return, if not something worth hoping for, freezing for, even being evicted\nfor? I felt sad. An old woman passed, bent down with two shopping bags, her\neyes upon the slushy walk, and I thought of the old couple at the eviction.\nHow had it ended and where were they now? What an awful emotion. What\nhad he called it -- a death on the city pavements? How often did such things\noccur? And what would he say of Mary? She was far from dead, or of being\nground to bits by New York. Hell, she knew very well how to live here, much\nbetter than I with my college training -- training! Bledsoing, that was the\nterm. And I was the one being ground up, not Mary. Thinking of her made\nme feel better. I couldn\'t imagine Mary being as helpless as the old woman\nat the eviction, and by the time I reached the apartment I had begun to lose\nmy depression.\nChapter 14\nThe odor of Mary\'s cabbage changed my mind. Standing engulfed in\nthe fumes filling the hall, it struck me that I couldn\'t realistically reject the\njob. Cabbage was always a depressing reminder of the leaner years of my\nchildhood and I suffered silently whenever she served it, but this was the\nthird time within the week and it dawned on me that Mary must be short of\nmoney.\nAnd here I\'ve been congratulating myself for refusing a job, I\nthought, when I don\'t even know how much money I owe her. I felt a quick\nsickness grow within me. How could I face her? I went quietly to my room\nand lay upon the bed, brooding. There were other roomers, who had jobs,\nand I knew she received help from relatives; still there was no mistake, Mary\nloved a variety of food and this concentration upon cabbage was no accident.\nWhy hadn\'t I noticed? She\'d been too kind, never dunning me, and I lay\nthere hearing her, "Don\'t come bothering me with your little troubles, boy.\nYou\'ll git something bye and bye" -- when I would try to apologize for not\npaying my rent and board. Perhaps another roomer had moved, or lost his\njob. What were Mary\'s problems anyway; who "articulated her grievances," as\nthe redheaded man had put it? She had kept me going for months, yet I had\nno idea. What kind of man was I becoming? I had taken her so much for\ngranted that I hadn\'t even thought of my debt when I refused the job. Nor\nhad I considered the embarrassment I might have caused her should the\npolice come to her home to arrest me for making that wild speech. Suddenly\nI felt an urge to go look at her, perhaps I had really never seen her. I had\nbeen acting like a child, not a man.\nTaking out the crumpled paper, I looked at the telephone number.\nHe had mentioned an organization. What was it called? I hadn\'t inquired.\nWhat a fool! At least I should have learned what I was turning down,\nalthough I distrusted the red-headed man. Had I refused out of fear as well\nas from resentment? Why didn\'t he just tell me what it was all about instead\nof trying to impress me with his knowledge?\nThen from down the hall I could hear Mary singing, her voice clear\nand untroubled, though she sang a troubled song. It was the "Back Water\nBlues." I lay listening as the sound flowed to and around me, bringing me a\ncalm sense of my indebtedness. When it faded I got up and put on my coat.\nPerhaps it was not too late. I would find a telephone and call him; then he\ncould tell me exactly what he wanted and I could make a sensible decision.\nMary heard me this time. "Boy, when you come home?" she said,\nsticking her head out of the kitchen. "I didn\'t even hear you."\n"I came in a short while ago," I said. "You were busy so I didn\'t\nbother you."\n"Then where you going so soon, ain\'t you going to eat supper?"\n"Yes, Mary," I said, "but I\'ve got to go out now. I forgot to take care\nof some business."\n"Shucks! What kind of business you got on a cold night like this?"\nshe said.\n"Oh, I don\'t know, I might have a surprise for you."\n"Won\'t nothing surprise me," she said. "And you hurry on back here\nand git something hot in your stomach."\nGoing through the cold seeking a telephone booth I realized that I\nhad committed myself to bring her some kind of surprise, and as I walked I\nbecame mildly enthusiastic. It was, after all, a job that promised to exercise\nmy talent for public speaking, and if the pay was anything at all it would be\nmore than I had now. At least I could pay Mary something of what I owed\nher. And she might receive some satisfaction that her prediction had proved\ncorrect.\nI seemed to be haunted by cabbage fumes; the little luncheonette in\nwhich I found the telephone was reeking.\nBrother Jack didn\'t sound at all surprised upon receiving my call.\n"I\'d like some information about --"\n"Get here as quickly as you can, we\'re leaving shortly," he said,\ngiving me a Lenox Avenue address and hanging up before I could finish my\nrequest.\nI went out into the cold, annoyed both by his lack of surprise and\nby the short, clipped manner in which he\'d spoken, but I started out, taking\nmy own time. It wasn\'t far, and just as I reached the corner of Lenox a car\npulled up and I saw several men inside, Jack among them, smiling.\n"Get in," he said. "We can talk where we\'re going. It\'s a party; you\nmight like it."\n"But I\'m not dressed," I said. "I\'ll call you tomorrow --"\n"Dressed?" he chuckled. "You\'re all right, get in."\nI got in beside him and the driver, noticing that there were three\nmen in the back. Then the car moved off.\nNo one spoke. Brother Jack seemed to sink immediately into deep\nthought. The others looked out into the night. It was as though we were\nmere chance passengers in a subway car. I felt uneasy, wondering where we\nwere going, but decided to say nothing. The car shot swiftly over the slush.\nLooking out at the passing night I wondered what kind of men they\nwere. Certainly they didn\'t act as though they were heading for a very\nsociable evening. I was hungry and I wouldn\'t get back in time for supper.\nWell, maybe it would be worth it, both to Mary and to me. At least I\nwouldn\'t have to eat that cabbage!\nFor a moment the car paused for the traffic light, then we were\ncircling swiftly through long stretches of snow-covered landscape lighted here\nand there by street lamps and the nervously stabbing beams of passing cars:\nWe were flashing through Central Park, now completely transformed by the\nsnow. It was as though we had plunged suddenly into mid-country peace, yet\nI knew that here, somewhere close by in the night, there was a zoo with its\ndangerous animals. The lions and tigers in heated cages, the bears asleep, the\nsnakes coiled tightly underground. And there was also the reservoir of dark\nwater, all covered by snow and by night, by snow-fall and by night-fall,\nburied beneath black and white, gray mist and gray silence. Then past the\ndriver\'s head I could see a wall of buildings looming beyond the windshield.\nThe car nosed slowly into traffic, dropped swiftly down a hill.\nWe stopped before an expensive-looking building in a strange part of\nthe city. I could see the word Chthonian on the storm awning stretched above\nthe walk as I got out with the others and went swiftly toward a lobby lighted\nby dim bulbs set behind frosted glass, going past the uniformed doorman\nwith an uncanny sense of familiarity; feeling now, as we entered a soundproof\nelevator and shot away at a mile a minute, that I had been through it all\nbefore. Then we were stopping with a gentle bounce and I was uncertain\nwhether we had gone up or down. Brother Jack guided me down the hall to\na door on which I saw a bronze door-knocker in the shape of a large-eyed\nowl. Now he hesitated a moment, his head thrust forward as though listening,\nthen his hand covered the owl from view, producing instead of the knock\nwhich I expected, an icy peal of clear chimes. Shortly the door swung partly\nopen, revealing a smartly dressed woman, whose hard, handsome face broke\ninto smiles.\n"Come in, Brothers," she said, her exotic perfume filling the foyer.\nI noticed a clip of blazing diamonds on her dress as I tried to stand\naside for the others, but Brother Jack pushed me ahead.\n"Excuse me," I said, but she held her ground, and I was pressing\ntensely against her perfumed softness, seeing her smile as though there were\nonly she and I. Then I was past, disturbed not so much by the close contact,\nas by the sense that I had somehow been through it all before. I couldn\'t\ndecide if it were from watching some similar scene in the movies, from books\nI\'d read, or from some recurrent but deeply buried dream. Whatsoever, it was\nlike entering a scene which, because of some devious circumstance, I had\nhitherto watched only from a distance. How could they have such an\nexpensive place, I wondered.\n"Put your things in the study," the woman said. "I\'ll go see about\ndrinks."\nWe entered a room lined with books and decorated with old musical\ninstruments: An Irish harp, a hunter\'s horn, a clarinet and a wooden flute\nwere suspended by the neck from the wall on pink and blue ribbons. There\nwere a leather divan and a number of easy chairs.\n"Throw your coat on the divan," Brother Jack said.\nI slid out of my overcoat and looked around. The dial of the radio\nbuilt into a section of the natural mahogany bookshelf was lighted, but I\ncouldn\'t hear any sound; and there was an ample desk on which rested silver\nand crystal writing things, and, as one of the men came to stand gazing at\nthe bookcase, I was struck by the contrast between the richness of the room\nand their rather poor clothing.\n"Now we\'ll go into the other room," Brother Jack said, taking me by\nthe arm.\nWe entered a large room in which one entire wall was hung with\nItalian-red draperies that fell in rich folds from the ceiling. A number of\nwell-dressed men and women were gathered in groups, some beside a grand\npiano, the others lounging in the pale beige upholstery of the blond wood\nchairs. Here and there I saw several attractive young women but carefully\navoided giving them more than a glance. I felt extremely uncomfortable,\nalthough after brief glances no one paid me any special attention. It was as\nthough they hadn\'t seen me, as though I were here, and yet not here. The\nothers were moving away to join the various groups now, and Brother Jack\ntook my arm.\n"Come, let\'s get a drink," he said, guiding me toward the end of the\nroom.\nThe woman who\'d let us in was mixing drinks behind a handsome\nfree-form bar which was large enough to have graced a night club.\n"How about a drink for us, Emma?" Brother Jack said.\n"Well, now, I\'ll have to think about it," she said, tilting her severely\ndrawn head and smiling.\n"Don\'t think, act," he said. "We\'re very thirsty men. This young man\npushed history ahead twenty years today."\n"Oh," she said, her eyes becoming intent. "You must tell me about\nhim."\n"Just read the morning papers, Emma. Things have begun to move.\nYes, leap ahead." He laughed deeply.\n"What would you like, Brother?" she said, her eyes brushing slowly\nover my face.\n"Bourbon," I said, a little too loudly, as I remembered the best the\nSouth had to offer. My face was warm, but I returned her glance as steadily\nas I dared. It was not the harsh uninterested-in-you-as-a-human-being stare\nthat I\'d known in the South, the kind that swept over a black man as though\nhe were a horse or an insect; it was something more, a direct,\nwhat-type-of-mere-man-have-we-here kind of look that seemed to go beneath\nmy skin . . . Somewhere in my leg a muscle twitched violently.\n"Emma, the bourbon! Two bourbons," Brother Jack said.\n"You know," she said, picking up a decanter, "I\'m intrigued."\n"Naturally. Always," he said. "Intrigued and intriguing. But we\'re\ndying of thirst."\n"Only of impatience," she said, pouring the drinks. "I mean you are.\nTell me, where did you find this young hero of the people?"\n"I didn\'t," Brother Jack said. "He simply arose out of a crowd. The\npeople always throw up their leaders, you know . . ."\n"Throw them up," she said. "Nonsense, they chew them up and spit\nthem out. Their leaders are made, not born. Then they\'re destroyed. You\'ve\nalways said that. Here you are, Brother."\nHe looked at her steadily. I took the heavy crystal glass and raised it\nto my lips, glad for an excuse to turn from her eyes. A haze of cigarette\nsmoke drifted through the room. I heard a series of rich arpeggios sound on\nthe piano behind me and turned to look, hearing the woman Emma say not\nquite softly enough, "But don\'t you think he should be a little blacker?"\n"Shhh, don\'t be a damn fool," Brother Jack said sharply. "We\'re not\ninterested in his looks but in his voice. And I suggest, Emma, that you make\nit your interest too . . ."\nSuddenly hot and breathless, I saw a window across the room and\nwent over and stood looking out. We were up very high; street lamps and\ntraffic cut patterns in the night below. So she doesn\'t think I\'m black enough.\nWhat does she want, a black-face comedian? Who is she, anyway, Brother\nJack\'s wife, his girl friend? Maybe she wants to see me sweat coal tar, ink,\nshoe polish, graphite. What was I, a man or a natural resource?\nThe window was so high that I could barely hear the sound of traffic\nbelow . . . This was a bad beginning, but hell, I was being hired by Brother\nJack, if he still wanted me, not this Emma woman. I\'d like to show her how\nreally black I am, I thought, taking a big drink of the bourbon. It was\nsmooth, cold. I\'d have to be careful with the stuff. Anything might happen if\nI had too much. With these people I\'ll have to be careful. Always careful.\nWith all people I\'ll have to be careful . . .\n"It\'s a pleasant view, isn\'t it?" a voice said, and I whirled to see a\ntall dark man. "But now would you mind joining us in the library?" he said.\nBrother Jack, the men who had come along in the car, and two\nothers whom I hadn\'t seen before were waiting.\n"Come in, Brother," Jack said. "Business before pleasure is always a\ngood rule, whoever you are. Some day the rule shall be business with\npleasure, for the joy of labor shall have been restored. Sit down."\nI took the chair directly before him, wondering what this speech was\nall about.\n"You know, Brother," he said, "we don\'t ordinarily interrupt our social\ngatherings with business, but with you it\'s necessary."\n"I\'m very sorry," I said. "I should have called you earlier."\n"Sorry? Why, we\'re only too glad to do so. We\'ve been waiting for\nyou for months. Or for someone who could do what you\'ve done."\n"But what . . . ?" I said.\n"What are we doing? What is our mission? It\'s simple; we are\nworking for a better world for all people. It\'s that simple. Too many have\nbeen dispossessed of their heritage, and we have banded together in\nbrotherhood so as to do something about it. What do you think of that?"\n"Why, I think it\'s fine," I said, trying to take in the full meaning of\nhis words. "I think it\'s excellent. But how?"\n"By moving them to action just as you did this morning. . . Brothers,\nI was there," he said to the others, "and he was magnificent. With a few\nwords he set off an effective demonstration against evictions!"\n"I was present too," another said. "It was amazing."\n"Tell us something of your background," Brother Jack said, his voice\nand manner demanding truthful answers. And I explained briefly that I had\ncome up looking for work to pay my way through college and had failed.\n"Do you still plan to return?"\n"Not now," I said. "I\'m all done with that."\n"It\'s just as well," Brother Jack said. "You have little to learn down\nthere. However, college training is not a bad thing -- although you\'ll have to\nforget most of it. Did you study economics?"\n"Some."\n"Sociology?"\n"Yes."\n"Well, let me advise you to forget it. You\'ll be given books to read\nalong with some material that explains our program in detail. But we\'re\nmoving too fast. Perhaps you aren\'t interested in working for the\nBrotherhood."\n"But you haven\'t told me what I\'m supposed to do," I said.\nHe looked at me fixedly, picking up his glass slowly and taking a\nlong swallow.\n"Let\'s put it this way," he said. "How would you like to be the new\nBooker T. Washington?"\n"What!" I looked into his bland eyes for laughter, seeing his red head\nturned slightly to the side. "Please, now," I said.\n"Oh, yes, I\'m serious."\n"Then I don\'t understand you." Was I drunk? I looked at him; he\nseemed sober.\n"What do you think of the idea? Or better still, what do you think of\nBooker T. Washington?"\n"Why, naturally, I think he was an important figure. At least most\npeople say so."\n"But?"\n"Well," I was at a loss for words. He was going too fast again. The\nwhole idea was insane and yet the others were looking at me calmly; one of\nthem was lighting up an underslung pipe. The match sputtered, caught fire.\n"What is it?" Brother Jack insisted.\n"Well, I guess I don\'t think he was as great as the Founder."\n"Oh? And why not?"\n"Well, in the first place, the Founder came before him and did\npractically everything Booker T. Washington did and a lot more. And more\npeople believed in him. You hear a lot of arguments about Booker T.\nWashington, but few would argue about the Founder . . ."\n"No, but perhaps that is because the Founder lies outside history,\nwhile Washington is still a living force. However, the new Washington shall\nwork for the poor . . ."\nI looked into my crystal glass of bourbon. It was unbelievable, yet\nstrangely exciting and I had the sense of being present at the creation of\nimportant events, as though a curtain had been parted and I was being\nallowed to glimpse how the country operated. And yet none of these men was\nwell known, or at least I\'d never seen their faces in the newspapers.\n"During these times of indecision when all the old answers are\nproven false, the people look back to the dead to give them a clue," he went\non. "They call first upon one and then upon another of those who have acted\nin the past."\n"If you please, Brother," the man with the pipe interrupted, "I think\nyou should speak more concretely."\n"Please don\'t interrupt," Brother Jack said icily.\n"I wish only to point out that a scientific terminology exists," the\nman said, emphasizing his words with his pipe. "After all, we call ourselves\nscientists here. Let us speak as scientists."\n"In due time," Brother Jack said. "In due time . . . You see,\nBrother," he said, turning to me, "the trouble is that there is little the dead\ncan do; otherwise they wouldn\'t be the dead. No! But on the other hand, it\nwould be a great mistake to assume that the dead are absolutely powerless.\nThey are powerless only to give the full answer to the new questions posed\nfor the living by history. But they try! Whenever they hear the imperious\ncries of the people in a crisis, the dead respond. Right now in this country,\nwith its many national groups, all the old heroes are being called back to life\n-- Jefferson, Jackson, Pulaski, Garibaldi, Booker T. Washington, Sun Yat-sen,\nDanny O\'Connell, Abraham Lincoln and countless others are being asked to\nstep once again upon the stage of history. I can\'t say too emphatically that\nwe stand at a terminal point in history, at a moment of supreme world crisis.\nDestruction lies ahead unless things are changed. And things must be\nchanged. And changed by the people. Because, Brother, the enemies of man\nare dispossessing the world! Do you understand?"\n"I\'m beginning to," I said, greatly impressed.\n"There are other terms, other more accurate ways of saying all this,\nbut we haven\'t time for that right now. We speak now in terms that are easy\nto understand. As you spoke to the crowd this morning."\n"I see," I said, feeling uncomfortable under his stare.\n"So it isn\'t a matter of whether you wish to be the new Booker T.\nWashington, my friend. Booker Washington was resurrected today at a certain\neviction in Harlem. He came out from the anonymity of the crowd and spoke\nto the people. So you see, I don\'t joke with you. Or play with words either.\nThere is a scientific explanation for this phenomenon -- as our learned\nbrother has graciously reminded me -- you\'ll learn it in time, but whatever\nyou call it the reality of the world crisis is a fact. We are all realists here,\nand materialists. It is a question of who shall determine the direction of\nevents. That is why we\'ve brought you into this room. This morning you\nanswered the people\'s appeal and we want you to be the true interpreter of\nthe people. You shall be the new Booker T. Washington, but even greater\nthan he."\nThere was silence. I could hear the wet cracking of the pipe.\n"Perhaps we should allow the Brother to express himself as to how\nhe feels about all this," the man with the pipe said.\n"Well, Brother?" Brother Jack said.\nI looked into their waiting faces.\n"It\'s all so new to me that I don\'t know exactly what I do think," I\nsaid. "Do you really think you have the right man?"\n"You mustn\'t let that worry you," Brother Jack said. "You will rise to\nthe task; it is only necessary that you work hard and follow instructions."\nThey stood up now. I looked at them, fighting a sense of unreality.\nThey stared at me as the fellows had done when I was being initiated into\nmy college fraternity. Only this was real and now was the time for me to\ndecide or to say I thought they were crazy and go back to Mary\'s. But what\nis there to lose? I thought. At least they\'ve invited me, one of us, in at the\nbeginning of something big; and besides, if I refused to join them, where\nwould I goto a job as porter at the railroad station? At least here was a\nchance to speak.\n"When shall I start?" I said.\n"Tomorrow, we must waste no time. By the way, where are you\nliving?"\n"I rent a room from a woman in Harlem," I said.\n"A housewife?"\n"She\'s a widow," I said. "She rents rooms."\n"What is her educational background?"\n"She\'s had very little."\n"More or less like the old couple that was evicted?"\n"Somewhat, but better able to take care of herself. She\'s tough," I\nsaid with a laugh.\n"Does she ask a lot of questions? Are you friendly with her?"\n"She\'s been very nice to me," I said. "She allowed me to stay on\nafter I was unable to pay my rent."\nHe shook his head. "No."\n"What is it?" I said.\n"It is best that you move," he said. "We\'ll find you a place further\ndowntown so that you\'ll be within easy call . . ."\n"But I have no money, and she\'s entirely trustworthy."\n"That will be taken care of," he said, waving his hand. "You must\nrealize immediately that much of our work is opposed. Our discipline\ndemands therefore that we talk to no one and that we avoid situations in\nwhich information might be given away unwittingly. So you must put aside\nyour past. Do you have a family?"\n"Yes."\n"Are you in touch with them?"\n"Of course. I write home now and then," I said, beginning to resent\nhis method of questioning. His voice had become cold, searching.\n"Then it\'s best that you cease for a while," he said. "Anyway, you\'ll\nbe too busy. Here." He fished into his vest pocket for something and got\nsuddenly to his feet.\n"What is it?" someone asked.\n"Nothing, excuse me," he said, rolling to the door and beckoning. In\na moment I saw the woman appear.\n"Emma, the slip of paper I gave you. Give it to the new Brother," he\nsaid as she stepped inside and closed the door.\n"Oh, so it\'s you," she said with a meaningful smile.\nI watched her reach into the bosom of her taffeta hostess gown and\nremove a white envelope.\n"This is your new identity," Brother Jack said. "Open it."\nInside I found a name written on a slip of paper.\n"That is your new name," Brother Jack said. "Start thinking of\nyourself by that name from this moment. Get it down so that even if you are\ncalled in the middle of the night you will respond. Very soon you shall be\nknown by it all over the country. You are to answer to no other,\nunderstand?"\n"I\'ll try," I said.\n"Don\'t forget his living quarters," the tall man said.\n"No," Brother Jack said with a frown. "Emma, please, some funds."\n"How much, Jack?" she said.\nHe turned to me. "Do you owe much rent?"\n"Too much," I said.\n"Make it three hundred, Emma," he said.\n"Never mind," he said as I showed my surprise at the sum. "This\nwill pay your debts and buy you clothing. Call me in the morning and I\'ll\nhave selected your living quarters. For a start your salary will be sixty dollars\na week."\nSixty a week! There was nothing I could say. The woman had\ncrossed the room to the desk and returned with the money, placing it in my\nhand.\n"You\'d better put it away," she said expansively.\n"Well, Brothers, I believe that\'s all," he said. "Emma, how about a\ndrink?"\n"Of course, of course," she said, going to a cabinet and removing a\ndecanter and a set of glasses in which she poured about an inch of clear\nliquid.\n"Here you are, Brothers," she said.\nTaking his, Brother Jack raised it to his nose, inhaling deeply. "To\nthe Brotherhood of Man . . . to History and to Change," he said, touching\nmy glass.\n"To History," we all said.\nThe stuff burned, causing me to lower my head to hide the tears that\npopped from my eyes.\n"Aaaah!" someone said with deep satisfaction.\n"Come along," Emma said. "Let\'s join the others."\n"Now for some pleasure," Brother Jack said. "And remember your\nnew identity."\nI wanted to think but they gave me no time. I was swept into the\nlarge room and introduced by my new name. Everyone smiled and seemed\neager to meet me, as though they all knew the role I was to play. All\ngrasped me warmly by the hand.\n"What is your opinion of the state of women\'s rights, Brother?" I was\nasked by a plain woman in a large black velvet tarn. But before I could open\nmy mouth, Brother Jack had pushed me along to a group of men, one of\nwhom seemed to know all about the eviction. Nearby, a group around the\npiano were singing folk songs with more volume than melody. We moved\nfrom group to group, Brother Jack very authoritative, the others always\nrespectful. He must be a powerful man, I thought, not a clown at all. But to\nhell with this Booker T. Washington business. I would do the work but I\nwould be no one except myself -- whoever I was, I would pattern my life on\nthat of the Founder. They might think I was acting like Booker T.\nWashington; let them. But what I thought of myself I would keep to myself.\nYes, and I\'d have to hide the fact that I had actually been afraid when I\nmade my speech. Suddenly I felt laughter bubbling inside me. I\'d have to\ncatch up with this science of history business.\nWe had come to stand near the piano now, where an intense young\nman questioned me about various leaders of the Harlem community. I knew\nthem only by name, but pretended that I knew them all.\n"Good," he said, "good, we have to work with all these forces during\nthe coming period."\n"Yes, you\'re quite right," I said, giving my glass a tinkling twirl. A\nshort broad man saw me and waved the others to a halt. "Say, Brother," he\ncalled. "Hold the music, boys, hold it!"\n"Yes, uh . . . Brother," I said.\n"You\'re just who we need. We been looking for you."\n"Oh," I said.\n"How about a spiritual, Brother? Or one of those real good ole Negro\nwork songs? Like this: Ah went to Atlanta -- nevah been there befo\'," he\nsang, his arms held out from his body like a penguin\'s wings, glass in one\nhand, cigar in the other. "White man sleep in a feather bed, Nigguh sleep on\nthe flo\' . . . Ha! Ha! How about it, Brother?"\n"The Brother does not sing!" Brother Jack roared staccato.\n"Nonsense, all colored people sing."\n"This is an outrageous example of unconscious racial chauvinism!"\nJack said.\n"Nonsense, I like their singing," the broad man said doggedly.\n"The Brother does not sing!" Brother Jack cried, his face turning a\ndeep purple.\nThe broad man regarded him stubbornly. "Why don\'t you let him say\nwhether he can sing or not . . . ? Come on, Brother, git hot! Go Down,\nMoses," he bellowed in a ragged baritone, putting down his cigar and\nsnapping his fingers. "Way down in Egypt\'s land. Tell dat ole Pharaoh to let\nma colored folks sing! I\'m for the rights of the colored brother to sing!" he\nshouted belligerently.\nBrother Jack looked as if he would choke; he raised his hand,\nsignaling. I saw two men shoot from across the room and lead the short man\nroughly away. Brother Jack followed them as they disappeared beyond the\ndoor, leaving an enormous silence.\nFor a moment I stood there, my eyes riveted upon the door, then I\nturned, the glass hot in my hand, my face feeling as though it would explode.\nWhy was everyone staring at me as though I were responsible? Why the hell\nwere they staring at me? Suddenly I yelled, "What\'s the matter with you?\nHaven\'t you ever seen a drunk --" when somewhere off the foyer the broad\nman\'s voice staggered drunkenly to us, "St. Louis mammieeeee -- with her\ndiamond riiiings . . ." and was clipped off by a slamming door, leaving a\nroomful of bewildered faces. And suddenly I was laughing hysterically.\n"He hit me in the face," I wheezed. "He hit me in the face with a\nyard of chitterlings!" -- bending double, roaring, the whole room seeming to\ndance up and down with each rapid eruption of laughter.\n"He threw a hog maw," I cried, but no one seemed to understand.\nMy eyes filled, I could barely see. "He\'s high as a Georgia pine," I laughed,\nturning to the group nearest me. "He\'s abso-lutely drunk . . . off music!"\n"Yes. Sure," a man said nervously. "Ha, ha . . ."\n"Three sheets in the wind," I laughed, getting my breath now, and\ndiscovering that the silent tension of the others was ebbing into a ripple of\nlaughter that sounded throughout the room, growing swiftly to a roar, a laugh\nof all dimensions, intensities and intonations. Everyone was joining in. The\nroom fairly bounced.\n"And did you see Brother Jack\'s face," a man shouted, shaking his\nhead.\n"It was murder!"\n"Go down Moses!"\n"I tell you it was murder!"\nAcross the room they were pounding someone on the back to keep\nhim from choking. Handkerchiefs appeared, there was much honking of noses,\nwiping of eyes. A glass crashed to the floor, a chair was overturned. I fought\nagainst the painful laughter, and as I calmed I saw them looking at me with\na sort of embarrassed gratitude. It was sobering and yet they seemed bent\nupon pretending that nothing unusual had happened. They smiled. Several\nseemed about to come over and pound my back, shake my hand. It was as\nthough I had told them something which they\'d wished very much to hear,\nhad rendered them an important service which I couldn\'t understand. But\nthere it was, working in their faces. My stomach ached. I wanted to leave, to\nget their eyes off me. Then a thin little woman came over and grasped my\nhand.\n"I\'m so sorry that this had to happen," she said in a slow Yankee\nvoice, "really and truly sorry. Some of our Brothers aren\'t so highly\ndeveloped, you know. Although they mean very well. You must allow me to\napologize for him . . ."\n"Oh, he was only tipsy," I said, looking into her thin, New England\nface.\n"Yes, I know, and revealingly so. I would never ask our colored\nbrothers to sing, even though I love to hear them. Because I know that it\nwould be a very backward thing. You are here to fight along with us, not to\nentertain. I think you understand me, don\'t you, Brother?"\nI gave her a silent smile.\n"Of course you do. I must go now, good-bye," she said, extending her\nlittle white-gloved hand and leaving.\nI was puzzled. Just what did she mean? Was it that she understood\nthat we resented having others think that we were all entertainers and natural\nsingers? But now after the mutual laughter something disturbed me: Shouldn\'t\nthere be some way for us to be asked to sing? Shouldn\'t the short man have\nthe right to make a mistake without his motives being considered consciously\nor unconsciously malicious? After all, he was singing, or trying to. What if I\nasked him to sing? I watched the little woman, dressed in black like a\nmissionary, winding her way through the crowd. What on earth was she doing\nhere? What part did she play? Well, whatever she meant, she\'s nice and I\nlike her.\nJust then Emma came up and challenged me to dance and I led her\ntoward the floor as the piano played, thinking of the vet\'s prediction and\ndrawing her to me as though I danced with such as her every evening. For\nhaving committed myself, I felt that I could never allow myself to show\nsurprise or upset -- even when confronted with situations furthest from my\nexperience. Otherwise I might be considered undependable, or unworthy. I felt\nthat somehow they expected me to perform even those tasks for which\nnothing in my experience -- except perhaps my imagination -- had prepared\nme. Still it was nothing new, white folks seemed always to expect you to\nknow those things which they\'d done everything they could think of to\nprevent you from knowing. The thing to do was to be prepared -- as my\ngrandfather had been when it was demanded that he quote the entire United\nStates Constitution as a test of his fitness to vote. He had confounded them\nall by passing the test, although they still refused him the ballot . . . Anyway,\nthese were different.\nIt was close to five A.M., many dances and many bourbons later,\nwhen I reached Mary\'s. Somehow, I felt surprised that the room was still the\nsame -- except that Mary had changed the bed linen. Good old Mary. I felt\nsadly sobered. And as I undressed I saw my outworn clothes and realized\nthat I\'d have to shed them. Certainly it was time. Even my hat would go; its\ngreen was sun-faded and brown, like a leaf struck by the winter\'s snows. I\nwould require a new one for my new name. A black broad-brimmed one;\nperhaps a homburg . . . humbug? I laughed. Well, I could leave packing for\ntomorrow -- I had very little, which was perhaps all to the good. I would\ntravel light, far and fast. They were fast people, all right. What a vast\ndifference between Mary and those for whom I was leaving her. And why\nshould it be this way, that the very job which might make it possible for me\nto do some of the things which she expected of me required that I leave her?\nWhat kind of room would Brother Jack select for me and why wasn\'t I left\nto select my own? It didn\'t seem right that in order to become a Harlem\nLeader I should live elsewhere. Yet nothing seemed right and I would have to\nrely upon their judgment. They seemed expert in such matters.\nBut how far could I trust them, and in what way were they different\nfrom the trustees? Whatever, I was committed; I\'d learn in the process of\nworking with them, I thought, remembering the money. The bills were crisp\nand fresh and I tried to imagine Mary\'s surprise when I paid her all my back\nrent and board. She\'d think that I was kidding. But money could never repay\nher generosity. She would never understand my wanting to move so quickly\nafter getting a job. And if I had any kind of success at all, it would seem the\nheight of ingratitude. How would I face her? She had asked for nothing in\nreturn. Or hardly anything, except that I make something of myself that she\ncalled a "race leader." I shivered in the cold. Telling her that I was moving\nwould be a hard proposition. I didn\'t like to think of it, but one couldn\'t be\nsentimental. As Brother Jack had said, History makes harsh demands of us\nall. But they were demands that had to be met if men were to be the\nmasters and not the victims of their times. Did I believe that? Perhaps I had\nalready begun to pay. Besides, I might as well admit right now, I thought,\nthat there are many things about people like Mary that I dislike. For one\nthing, they seldom know where their personalities end and yours begins; they\nusually think in terms of "we" while I have always tended to think in terms\nof "me" -- and that has caused some friction, even with my own family.\nBrother Jack and the others talked in terms of "we," but it was a different,\nbigger "we."\nWell, I had a new name and new problems. I had best leave the old\nbehind. Perhaps it would be best not to see Mary at all, just place the money\nin an envelope and leave it on the kitchen table where she\'d be sure to find\nit. It would be better that way, I thought drowsily; then there\'d be no need\nto stand before her and stumble over emotions and words that were at best\nall snarled up and undifferentiated . . . One thing about the people at the\nChthonian, they all seemed able to say just what they felt and meant in hard,\nclear terms. That too, I\'d have to learn . . . I stretched out beneath the\ncovers, hearing the springs groan beneath me. The room was cold. I listened\nto the night sounds of the house. The clock ticked with empty urgency, as\nthough trying to catch up with the time. In the street a siren howled.\nChapter 15\nThen I was awake and not awake, sitting bolt upright in bed and\ntrying to peer through the sick gray light as I sought the meaning of the\nbrash, nerve-jangling sound. Pushing the blanket aside I clasped my hands to\nmy ears. Someone was pounding the steam line, and I stared helplessly for\nwhat seemed minutes. My ears throbbed. My side began itching violently and\nI tore open my pajamas to scratch, and suddenly the pain seemed to leap\nfrom my ears to my side and I saw gray marks appearing where the old skin\nwas flaking away beneath my digging nails. And as I watched I saw thin lines\nof blood well up in the scratches, bringing pain and joining time and place\nagain, and I thought, The room has lost its heat on my last day at Mary\'s,\nand suddenly I was sick at heart.\nThe clock, its alarm lost in the larger sound, said seven-thirty, and I\ngot out of bed. I\'d have to hurry. There was shopping to do before I called\nBrother Jack for my instructions and I had to get the money to Mary -- Why\ndidn\'t they stop that noise? I reached for my shoes, flinching as the knocking\nseemed to sound an inch above my head. Why don\'t they stop, I thought.\nAnd why do I feel so let down? The bourbon? My nerves going bad?\nSuddenly I was across the room in a bound, pounding the pipe\nfuriously with my shoe heel.\n"Stop it, you ignorant fool!"\nMy head was splitting. Beside myself, I struck pieces of silver from\nthe pipe, exposing the black and rusted iron. He was using a piece of metal\nnow, his blows ringing with a ragged edge.\nIf only I knew who it was, I thought, looking for something heavy\nwith which to strike back. If only I knew!\nThen near the door I saw something which I\'d never noticed there\nbefore: the cast-iron figure of a very black, red-lipped and wide-mouthed\nNegro, whose white eyes stared up at me from the floor, his face an\nenormous grin, his single large black hand held palm up before his chest. It\nwas a bank, a piece of early Americana, the kind of bank which, if a coin is\nplaced in the hand and a lever pressed upon the back, will raise its arm and\nflip the coin into the grinning mouth. For a second I stopped, feeling hate\ncharging within me, then dashed over and grabbed it, suddenly as enraged by\nthe tolerance or lack of discrimination, or whatever, that allowed Mary to\nkeep such a self-mocking image around, as by the knocking.\nIn my hand its expression seemed more of a strangulation than a\ngrin. It was choking, filled to the throat with coins.\nHow the hell did it get here, I wondered, dashing over and striking\nthe pipe a blow with the kinky iron head. "Shut up!" I screamed, which\nseemed only to enrage the hidden knocker. The din was deafening. Tenants\nup and down the entire line of apartments joined in. I hammered back with\nthe iron naps, seeing the silver fly, striking like driven sand against my face.\nThe pipe fairly hummed with the blows. Windows were going up. Voices\nyelled obscenities down the airshaft.\nWho started all this, I wondered, who\'s responsible?\n"Why don\'t you act like responsible people living in the twentieth\ncentury?" I yelled, aiming a blow at the pipe. "Get rid of your cottonpatch\nways! Act civilized!"\nThen came a crash of sound and I felt the iron head crumble and fly\napart in my hand. Coins flew over the room like crickets, ringing, rattling\nagainst the floor, rolling. I stopped dead.\n"Just listen to \'em! Just listen to \'em!" Mary called from the hall.\n"Enough noise to wake the dead! They know when the heat don\'t come up\nthat the super\'s drunk or done walked off the job looking for his woman, or\nsomething. Why don\'t folks act according to what they know?"\nShe was at my door now, knocking stroke for stroke with the blows\nlanding on the pipe, calling, "Son! Ain\'t some of that knocking coming from\nin there?"\nI turned from side to side in indecision, looking at the pieces of\nbroken head, the small coins of all denominations that were scattered about.\n"You hear me, boy?" she called.\n"What is it?" I called, dropping to the floor and reaching frantically\nfor the broken pieces, thinking, If she opens the door, I\'m lost . . .\n"I said is any of that racket coming from in there?"\n"Yes, it is, Mary," I called, "but I\'m all right . . . I\'m already awake."\nI saw the knob move and froze, hearing, "Sounded to me like a heap\nof it was coming from in there. You got your clothes on?"\n"No," I cried. "I\'m just dressing. I\'ll have them on in a minute."\n"Come on out to the kitchen," she said. "It\'s warm out there. And\nthere\'s some hot water on the stove to wash your face in . . . and some\ncoffee. Lawd, just listen at the racket!"\nI stood as though frozen, until she moved away from the door. I\'d\nhave to hurry. I kneeled, picking up a piece of the bank, a part of the\nred-shirted chest, reading the legend, FEED ME in a curve of white iron\nletters, like the team name on an athlete\'s shirt. The figure had gone to\npieces like a grenade, scattering jagged fragments of painted iron among the\ncoins. I looked at my hand; a small trickle of blood showed. I wiped it away,\nthinking, I\'ll have to hide this mess! I can\'t take her this and the news that\nI\'m moving at the same time. Taking a newspaper from the chair I folded it\nstiffly and swept the coins and broken metal into a pile. Where would I hide\nit, I wondered, looking with profound distaste at the iron kinks, the dull red\nof a piece of grinning lip. Why, I thought with anguish, would Mary have\nsomething like this around anyway? Just why? I looked under the bed. It was\ndustless there, no place to hide anything. She was too good a housekeeper.\nBesides, what of the coins? Hell! Maybe the thing was left by the former\nroomer. Anyway, whose ever it was, it had to be hidden. There was the\ncloset, but she\'d find it there too. After I was gone a few days she\'d clean\nout my things and there it\'d be. The knocking had gone beyond mere protest\nover heatlessness now, they had fallen into a ragged rumba rhythm:\nKnock!\nKnock-knock\nKnock-knock!\nKnock!\nKnock-knock!\nKnock-knock!\nvibrating the very floor.\n"Just a few minutes more, you bastards," I said aloud, "and I\'ll be\ngone! No respect for the individual. Why don\'t you think about those who\nmight wish to sleep? What if someone is near a nervous breakdown . . . ?"\nBut there was still the package. There was nothing to do but get rid\nof it along the way downtown. Making a tight bundle, I placed it in my\novercoat pocket. I\'d simply have to give Mary enough money to cover the\ncoins. I\'d give her as much as I could spare, half of what I had, if necessary.\nThat should make up for some of it. She should appreciate that. And now I\nrealized with a feeling of dread that I had to meet her face to face. There\nwas no way out. Why can\'t I just tell her that I\'m leaving and pay her and\ngo on off? She was a landlady, I was a tenant -- No, there was more to it\nand I wasn\'t hard enough, scientific enough, even to tell her that I was\nleaving. I\'ll tell her I have a job, anything, but it has to be now.\nShe was sitting at the table drinking coffee when I went in, the\nkettle hissing away on the stove, sending up jets of steam.\n"Gee, but you slow this morning," she said. "Take some of that water\nin the kettle and go wash your face. Though sleepy as you look, maybe you\nought to just use cold water."\n"This\'ll do," I said flatly, feeling the steam drifting upon my face,\ngrowing swiftly damp and cold. The clock above the stove was slower than\nmine.\nIn the bathroom I put in the plug and poured some of the hot water\nand cooled it from the spigot. I kept the tear-warm water upon my face a\nlong time, then dried and returned to the kitchen.\n"Run it full again," she said when I returned. "How you feel?"\n"So-so," I said.\nShe sat with her elbows upon the enameled table top, her cup held\nin both hands, one work-worn little finger delicately curved. I went to the\nsink and turned the spigot, feeling the cold rush of water upon my hand,\nthinking of what I had to do . . .\n"That\'s enough there, boy," Mary said, startling me. "Wake up!"\n"I guess I\'m not all here," I said. "My mind was wandering."\n"Well, call it back and come get you some coffee. Soon\'s I\'ve had\nmine, I\'ll see what kind of breakfast I can whip together. I guess after last\nnight you can eat this morning. You didn\'t come back for supper."\n"I\'m sorry," I said. "Coffee will be enough for me."\n"Boy, you better start eating again," she warned, pouring me a full\ncup of coffee.\nI took the cup and sipped it, black. It was bitter. She glanced from\nme to the sugar bowl and back again but remained silent, then swirled her\ncup, looking into it.\n"Guess I\'ll have to get some better filters," she mused. "These I got\nlets through the grounds along with the coffee, the good with the bad. I don\'t\nknow though, even with the best of filters you apt to find a ground or two at\nthe bottom of your cup."\nI blew upon the steaming liquid, avoiding Mary\'s eyes. The knocking\nwas becoming unbearable again. I\'d have to get away. I looked at the hot\nmetallic surface of the coffee, noticing on oily, opalescent swirl.\n"Look, Mary," I said, plunging in, "I want to talk to you about\nsomething."\n"Now see here, boy," she said gruffly, "I don\'t want you worrying me\nabout your rent this morning. I\'m not worried \'cause when you get it I know\nyou\'ll pay me. Meanwhile you forget it. Nobody in this house is going to\nstarve. You having any luck lining up a job?"\n"No -- I mean not exactly," I stammered, seizing the opportunity.\n"But I\'ve got an appointment to see about one this morning . . ."\nHer face brightened. "Oh, that\'s fine. You\'ll get something yet. I know\nit."\n"But about my debt," I began again.\n"Don\'t worry about it. How about some hotcakes?" she asked, rising\nand going to look into the cabinet. "They\'ll stick with you in this cold\nweather."\n"I won\'t have time," I said. "But I\'ve got something for you . . ."\n"What\'s that?" she said, her voice coming muffled as she peered\ninside the cabinet.\n"Here," I said hurriedly reaching into my pocket for the money.\n"What? -- Let\'s see if I got some syrup . . ."\n"But look," I said eagerly, removing a hundred-dollar bill.\n"Must be on a higher shelf," she said, her back still turned.\nI sighed as she dragged a step ladder from beside the cabinet and\nmounted it, holding onto the doors and peering upon an upper shelf. I\'d\nnever get it said. . .\n"But I\'m trying to give you something," I said.\n"Why don\'t you quit bothering me, boy? You trying to give me\nwhat?" she said looking over her shoulder.\nI held up the bill. "This," I said.\nShe craned her head around. "Boy, what you got there?"\n"It\'s money."\n"Money? Good God, boy!" she said, almost losing her balance as she\nturned completely around. "Where\'d you get all that much money? You been\nplaying the numbers?"\n"That\'s it. My number came up," I said thankfully -- thinking, What\'ll\nI say if she asks what the number was? I didn\'t know. I had never played.\n"But how come you didn\'t tell me? I\'d have at least put a nickel on\nit."\n"I didn\'t think it would do anything," I said.\n"Well, I declare. And I bet it was your first time too."\n"It was."\n"See there, I knowed you was a lucky one. Here I been playing for\nyears and the first drop of the bucket you hits for that kinda money. I\'m sho\nglad for you, son. I really am. But I don\'t want your money. You wait \'til you\nget a job."\n"But I\'m not giving you all of it," I said hastily. "This is just on\naccount."\n"But that\'s a hundred-dollar bill. I take that an\' try to change it and\nthe white folks\'ll want to know my whole life\'s history." She snorted. "They\nwant to know where I was born, where I work, and where I been for the last\nsix months, and when I tell \'em they still gonna think I stole it. Ain\'t you\ngot nothing smaller?"\n"That\'s the smallest. Take it," I pleaded. "I\'ll have enough left."\nShe looked at me shrewdly. "You sho?"\n"It\'s the truth," I said.\n"Well, I de-clare -- Let me get down from up here before I fall and\nbreak my neck! Son," she said, coming down off the ladder, "I sho do\nappreciate it. But I tell you, I\'m just going to keep part of it for myself and\nthe rest I\'m going to save for you. You get hard up just come to Mary."\n"I think I\'ll be all right now," I said, watching her fold the money\ncarefully, placing it in the leather bag that always hung on the back of her\nchair.\n"I\'m really glad, \'cause now I can take care of that bill they been\nbothering me about. It\'ll do me so much good to go in there and plop down\nsome money and tell them folks to quit bothering me. Son, I believe your\nluck done changed. You dream that number?"\nI glanced at her eager face. "Yes," I said, "but it was a mixed-up\ndream."\n"What was the figger -- Jesus! What\'s this!" she cried, getting up and\npointing at the linoleum near the steam line.\nI saw a small drove of roaches trooping frantically down the steam\nline from the floor above, plummeting to the floor as the vibration of the\npipe shook them off.\n"Get the broom!" Mary yelled. "Out of the closet there!"\nStepping around the chair I snatched the broom and joined her,\nsplattering the scattering roaches with both broom and feet, hearing the pop\nand snap as I brought the pressure down upon them vehemently.\n"The filthy, stinking things," Mary cried. "Git that one under the\ntable! Yon\' he goes, don\'t let him git away! The nasty rascal!"\nI swung the broom, battering and sweeping the squashed insects into\npiles. Breathing excitedly Mary got the dust pan and handed it to me.\n"Some folks just live in filth," she said disgustedly. "Just let a little\nknocking start and here it comes crawling out. All you have to do is shake\nthings up a bit."\nI looked at the damp spots on the linoleum, then shakily replaced\nthe pan and broom and started out of the room.\n"Aren\'t you going to eat no breakfast?" she said. "Soon\'s I wipe up\nthis mess I\'m going to start."\n"I don\'t have time," I said, my hand on the knob. "My appointment\nis early and I have a few things to do beforehand."\n"Then you better stop and have you something hot soon as you can.\nDon\'t do to go around in this cold weather without something in your belly.\nAnd don\'t think you goin\' start eating out just \'cause you got some money!"\n"I don\'t. I\'ll take care of it," I said to her back as she washed her\nhands.\n"Well, good luck, son," she called. "You really give me a pleasant\nsurprise this morning -- and if that\'s a lie, I hope something big\'ll bite me!"\nShe laughed gaily and I went down the hall to my room and closed\nthe door. Pulling on my overcoat I got down my prized brief case from the\ncloset. It was still as new as the night of the battle royal, and sagged now as\nI placed the smashed bank and coins inside and locked the flap. Then I\nclosed the closet door and left.\nThe knocking didn\'t bother me so much now. Mary was singing\nsomething sad and serene as I went down the hall, and still singing as I\nopened the door and stepped into the outside hall. Then I remembered, and\nthere beneath the dim hall light I took the faintly perfumed paper from my\nwallet and carefully unfolded it. A tremor passed over me; the hall was cold.\nThen it was gone and I squinted and took a long, hard look at my new\nBrotherhood name.\nThe night\'s snowfall was already being churned to muck by the\npassing cars, and it was warmer. Joining the pedestrians along the walk, I\ncould feel the brief case swinging against my leg from the weight of the\npackage, and I determined to get rid of the coins and broken iron at the first\nash can. I needed nothing like this to remind me of my last morning at\nMary\'s.\nI made for a row of crushed garbage cans lined before a row of old\nprivate houses, coming alongside and tossing the package casually into one of\nthem and moving on -- only to hear a door open behind me and a voice ring\nout,\n"Oh, no you don\'t, oh, no you don\'t! Just come right back here and\nget it!"\nTurning, I saw a little woman standing on the stoop with a green\ncoat covering her head and shoulders, its sleeves hanging limp like extra\natrophied arms.\n"I mean you," she called. "Come on back an\' get your trash. An\'\ndon\'t ever put your trash in my can again!"\nShe was a short yellow woman with a pince-nez on a chain, her hair\npinned up in knots.\n"We keep our place clean and respectable and we don\'t want you\nfield niggers coming up here from the South and ruining things," she shouted\nwith blazing hate.\nPeople were stopping to look. A super from a building down the\nblock came out and stood in the middle of the walk, pounding his fist against\nhis palm with a dry, smacking sound. I hesitated, embarrassed and annoyed.\nWas this woman crazy?\n"I mean it! Yes, you! I\'m talking to you! Just take it right out!\nRosalie," she called to someone inside the house, "call the police, Rosalie!"\nI can\'t afford that, I thought, and walked back to the can. "What\ndoes it matter, Miss?" I called up to her. "When the collectors come, garbage\nis garbage. I just didn\'t want to throw it into the street. I didn\'t know that\nsome kinds of garbage were better than others."\n"Never mind your impertinence," she said. "I\'m sick and tired of\nhaving you southern Negroes mess up things for the rest of us!"\n"All right," I said, "I\'ll get it out."\nI reached into the half-filled can, feeling for the package, as the\nfumes of rotting swill entered my nostrils. It felt unhealthy to my hand, and\nthe heavy package had sunk far down. Cursing, I pushed back my sleeve with\nmy clean hand and probed until I found it. Then I wiped off my arm with a\nhandkerchief and started away, aware of the people who paused to grin at\nme.\n"It serves you right," the little woman called from the stoop.\nAnd I turned and started upward. "That\'s enough out of you, you\npiece of yellow gone-to-waste. Unless you still want to call the police." My\nvoice had taken on a new shrill pitch. "I\'ve done what you wanted me to do;\nanother word and I\'ll do what I want to do --"\nShe looked at me with widening eyes. "I believe you would," she\nsaid, opening the door. "I believe you would."\n"I not only would, I\'d love it," I said.\n"I can see that you\'re no gentleman," she called, slamming the door,\nAt the next row of cans I wiped off my wrist and hands with a piece\nof newspaper, then wrapped the rest around the package. Next time I\'d throw\nit into the street.\nTwo blocks further along my anger had ebbed, but I felt strangely\nlonely. Even the people who stood around me at the intersection seemed\nisolated, each lost in his own thoughts. And now just as the lights changed I\nlet the package fall into the trampled snow and hurried across, thinking,\nThere, it\'s done.\nI had covered two blocks when someone called behind me, "Say,\nbuddy! Hey, there! You, Mister . . . Wait a second!" and I could hear the\nhurried crunching of footsteps upon the snow. Then he was beside me, a\nsquat man in worn clothes, the strands of his breath showing white in the\ncold as he smiled at me, panting.\n"You was moving so fast I thought I wasn\'t going to be able to stop\nyou," he said. "Didn\'t you lose something back there a piece?"\nOh, hell, a friend in need, I thought, deciding to deny it. "Lose\nsomething?" I said. "Why, no."\n"You sure?" he said, frowning.\n"Yes," I said, seeing his forehead wrinkle with uncertainty, a hot\ncharge of fear leaping to his eyes as he searched my face.\n"But I seen you -- Say, buddy," he said, looking swiftly back up the\nstreet, "what you trying to do?"\n"Do? What do you mean?"\n"I mean talking \'bout you didn\'t lose nothing. You working a con\ngame or something?" He backed away, looking hurriedly at the pedestrians\nback up the street from where he\'d come.\n"What on earth are you talking about now?" I said. "I tell you I\ndidn\'t lose anything."\n"Man, don\'t tell me! I seen you. What the hell you mean?" he said,\nfurtively removing the package from his pocket. "This here feels like money or\na gun or something and I know damn well I seen you drop it."\n"Oh, that," I said. "That isn\'t anything -- I thought you --"\n"That\'s right, \'Oh.\' So you remember now, don\'t you? I think I\'m\ndoing you a favor and you play me for a fool. You some kind of confidence\nman or dope peddler or something? You trying to work one of those pigeon\ndrops on me?"\n"Pigeon drop?" I said. "You\'re making a mistake --"\n"Mistake, hell! Take this damn stuff," he said, thrusting the package\nin my hands as though it were a bomb with a lighted fuse. "I got a family,\nman. I try to do you a favor and here you trying to get me into trouble --\nYou running from a detective or somebody?"\n"Wait a minute," I said. "You\'re letting your imagination run away;\nthis is nothing but garbage --"\n"Don\'t try to hand me that simple-minded crap," he wheezed. "I\nknow what kind of garbage it is. You young New York Negroes is a blip! I\nswear you is! I hope they catch you and put your ass under the jail!"\nHe shot away as though I had smallpox. I looked at the package. He\nthinks it\'s a gun or stolen goods, I thought, watching him go. A few steps\nfarther along I was about to toss it boldly into the street when upon looking\nback I saw him, joined by another man now, gesturing toward me\nindignantly. I hurried away. Give him time and the fool\'ll call a policeman. I\ndropped the package back into the brief case. I\'d wait until I got downtown.\nOn the subway people around me were reading their morning papers,\npressing forward their unpleasant faces. I rode with my eyes shut, trying to\nmake my mind blank to thoughts of Mary. Then turning, I saw the item\nViolent Protest Over Harlem Eviction, just as the man lowered his paper and\nmoved out of the breaking doors. I could hardly wait until I reached 42nd\nStreet, where I found the story carried on the front page of a tabloid, and I\nread it eagerly. I was referred to only as an unknown "rabble rouser" who\nhad disappeared in the excitement, but that it referred to me was\nunmistakable. It had lasted for two hours, the crowd refusing to vacate the\npremises. I entered the clothing store with a new sense of self-importance.\nI selected a more expensive suit than I\'d intended, and while it was\nbeing altered I picked up a hat, shorts, shoes, underwear and socks, then\nhurried to call Brother Jack, who snapped his orders like a general. I was to\ngo to a number on the upper East Side where I\'d find a room, and I was to\nread over some of the Brotherhood\'s literature which had been left there for\nme, with the idea of my making a speech at a Harlem rally to be held that\nevening.\nThe address was that of an undistinguished building in a mixed\nSpanish-Irish neighborhood, and there were boys throwing snowballs across\nthe street when I rang the super\'s bell. The door was opened by a small\npleasant-faced woman who smiled.\n"Good morning, Brother," she said. "The apartment is all ready for\nyou. He said you\'d come about this time and I\'ve just this minute come\ndown. My, just look at that snow."\nI followed her up the three flights of stairs, wondering what on earth\nI\'d do with a whole apartment.\n"This is it," she said, removing a chain of keys from her pocket and\nopening a door at the front of the hall. I went into a small comfortably\nfurnished room that was bright with the winter sun. "This is the living room,"\nshe said proudly, "and over here is your bedroom."\nIt was much larger than I needed, with a chest of drawers, two\nupholstered chairs, two closets, a bookshelf and a desk on which was stacked\nthe literature to which he\'d referred. A bathroom lay off the bedroom, and\nthere was a small kitchen.\n"I hope you like it, Brother," she said, as she left. "If there\'s anything\nyou need, please ring my bell."\nThe apartment was clean and neat and I liked it -- especially the\nbathroom with its tub and shower. And as quickly as I could I drew a bath\nand soaked myself. Then feeling clean and exhilarated I went out to puzzle\nover the Brotherhood books and pamphlets. My brief case with the broken\nimage lay on the table. I would get rid of the package later; right now I had\nto think about tonight\'s rally.\nChapter 16\nAt seven-thirty Brother Jack and some of the others picked me up\nand we shot up to Harlem in a taxi. As before, no one spoke a word. There\nwas only the sound made by a man in the corner who drew noisily on a\npipeful of rum-flavored tobacco, causing it to glow on and off, a red disk in\nthe dark. I rode with mounting nervousness; the taxi seemed unnaturally\nwarm. We got out in a side street and went down a narrow alley in the dark\nto the rear of the huge, barn-like building. Other members had already\narrived.\n"Ah, here we are," Brother Jack said, leading the way through a dark\nrear door to a dressing room lighted by naked, low-hanging bulbs -- a small\nroom with wooden benches and a row of steel lockers with a network of\nnames scratched on the doors. It had a football-locker smell of ancient sweat,\niodine, blood and rubbing alcohol, and I felt a welling up of memories.\n"We remain here until the building fills," Brother Jack said. "Then we\nmake our appearance -- just at the height of their impatience." He gave me a\ngrin. "Meanwhile, you think about what you\'ll say. Did you look over the\nmaterial?"\n"All day," I said.\n"Good. I suggest, however, that you listen carefully to the rest of us.\nWe\'ll all precede you so that you can get pointers for your remarks. You\'ll be\nlast."\nI nodded, seeing him take two of the other men by the arm and\nretreat to a corner. I was alone, the others were studying their notes, talking.\nI went across the room to a torn photograph tacked to the faded wall. It was\na shot, in fighting stance, of a former prizefight champion, a popular fighter\nwho had lost his sight in the ring. It must have been right here in this\narena, I thought. That had been years ago. The photograph was that of a\nman so dark and battered that he might have been of any nationality. Big\nand loose-muscled, he looked like a good man. I remembered my father\'s\nstory of how he had been beaten blind in a crooked fight, of the scandal that\nhad been suppressed, and how the fighter had died in a home for the blind.\nWho would have thought I\'d ever come here? How things were twisted\naround! I felt strangely sad and went and slouched on a bench. The others\ntalked on, their voices low. I watched them with a sudden resentment. Why\ndid I have to come last? What if they bored the audience to death before I\ncame on! I\'d probably be shouted down before I could get started . . . But\nperhaps not, I thought, jabbing my suspicions away. Perhaps I could make an\neffect through the sheer contrast between my approach and theirs. Maybe that\nwas the strategy . . . Anyway, I had to trust them. I had to.\nStill a nervousness clung to me. I felt out of place. From beyond the\ndoor I could hear a distant scrape of chairs, a murmur of voices. Little\nworries whirled up within me: That I might forget my new name; that I\nmight be recoginzed from the audience. I bent forward, suddenly conscious of\nmy legs in new blue trousers. But how do you know they\'re your legs? What\'s\nyour name? I thought, making a sad joke with myself. It was absurd, but it\nrelieved my nervousness. For it was as though I were looking at my own legs\nfor the first time -- independent objects that could of their own volition lead\nme to safety or danger. I stared at the dusty floor. Then it was as though I\nwere returning after a long suspension of consciousness, as though I stood\nsimultaneously at opposite ends of a tunnel. I seemed to view myself from\nthe distance of the campus while yet sitting there on a bench in the old\narena; dressed in a new blue suit; sitting across the room from a group of\nintense men who talked among themselves in hushed, edgy voices; while yet\nin the distance I could hear the clatter of chairs, more voices, a cough. I\nseemed aware of it all from a point deep within me, yet there was a\ndisturbing vagueness about what I saw, a disturbing unformed quality, as\nwhen you see yourself in a photo exposed during adolescence: the expression\nempty, the grin without character, the ears too large, the pimples, "courage\nbumps," too many and too well-defined. This was a new phase, I realized, a\nnew beginning, and I would have to take that part of myself that looked on\nwith remote eyes and keep it always at the distance of the campus, the\nhospital machine, the battle royal -- all now far behind. Perhaps the part of\nme that observed listlessly but saw all, missing nothing, was still the\nmalicious, arguing part; the dissenting voice, my grandfather part; the cynical,\ndisbelieving part -- the traitor self that always threatened internal discord.\nWhatever it was, I knew that I\'d have to keep it pressed down. I had to. For\nif I were successful tonight, I\'d be on the road to something big. No more\nflying apart at the seams, no more remembering forgotten pains . . . No, I\nthought, shifting my body, they\'re the same legs on which I\'ve come so far\nfrom home. And yet they were somehow new. The new suit imparted a\nnewness to me. It was the clothes and the new name and the circumstances.\nIt was a newness too subtle to put into thought, but there it was. I was\nbecoming someone else.\nI sensed vaguely and with a flash of panic that the moment I walked\nout upon the platform and opened my mouth I\'d be someone else. Not just a\nnobody with a manufactured name which might have belonged to anyone, or\nto no one. But another personality. Few people knew me now, but after\ntonight . . . How was it? Perhaps simply to be known, to be looked upon by\nso many people, to be the focal point of so many concentrating eyes, perhaps\nthis was enough to make one different; enough to transform one into\nsomething else, someone else; just as by becoming an increasingly larger boy\none became one day a man; a man with a deep voice -- although my voice\nhad been deep since I was twelve. But what if someone from the campus\nwandered into the audience? Or someone from Mary\'s -- even Mary herself?\n"No, it wouldn\'t change it," I heard myself say softly, "that\'s all past." My\nname was different; I was under orders. Even if I met Mary on the street, I\'d\nhave to pass her by unrecognized. A depressing thought -- and I got up\nabruptly and went out of the dressing room and into the alley.\nWithout my overcoat it was cold. A feeble light burned above the\nentrance, sparkling the snow. I crossed the alley to the dark side, stopping\nnear a fence that smelled of carbolic acid, which, as I looked back across the\nalley, caused me to remember a great abandoned hole that had been the site\nof a sports arena that had burned before my birth. All that was left, a cliff\ndrop of some forty feet below the heat-buckled walk, was the shell of\nconcrete with weirdly bent and rusted rods that had been its basement. The\nhole was used for dumping, and after a rain it stank with stagnant water.\nAnd now in my mind I stood upon the walk looking out across the hole past\na Hooverville shanty of packing cases and bent tin signs, to a railroad yard\nthat lay beyond. Dark depthless water lay without motion in the hole, and\npast the Hooverville a switch engine idled upon the shining rails, and as a\nplume of white steam curled slowly from its funnel I saw a man come out of\nthe shanty and start up the path which led to the walk above. Stooped and\ndark and sprouting rags from his shoes, hat and sleeves, he shuffled slowly\ntoward me, bringing a threatening cloud of carbolic acid. It was a syphilitic\nwho lived alone in the shanty between the hole and the railroad yard, coming\nup to the street only to beg money for food and disinfectant with which to\nsoak his rags. Then in my mind I saw him stretching out a hand from which\nthe fingers had been eaten away and I ran -- back to the dark, and the cold\nand the present.\nI shivered, looking toward the street, where up the alley through the\ntunneling dark, three mounted policemen loomed beneath the circular,\nsnow-sparkling beam of the street lamp, grasping their horses by their bridles,\nthe heads of both men and animals bent close, as though plotting; the leather\nof saddles and leggings shining. Three white men and three black horses.\nThen a car passed and they showed in full relief, their shadows flying like\ndreams across the sparkle of snow and darkness. And, as I turned to leave,\none of the horses violently tossed its head and I saw the gauntleted fist\nyanked down. Then there was a wild neigh and the horse plunged off in the\ndark, the crisp, frantic clanking of metal and the stomping of hooves followed\nme to the door. Perhaps this was something for Brother Jack to know.\nBut inside they were still in a huddle, and I went back and sat on\nthe bench.\nI watched them, feeling very young and inexperienced and yet\nstrangely old, with an oldness that watched and waited quietly within me.\nOutside, the audience had begun to drone; a distant, churning sound that\nbrought back some of the terror of the eviction. My mind flowed. There was\na child standing in rompers outside a chicken-wire fence, looking in upon a\nhuge black-and-white dog, log-chained to an apple tree. It was Master, the\nbulldog; and I was the child who was afraid to touch him, although, panting\nwith heat, he seemed to grin back at me like a fat good-natured man, the\nsaliva roping silvery from his jowls. And as the voices of the crowd churned\nand mounted and became an impatient splatter of hand claps, I thought of\nMaster\'s low hoarse growl. He had barked the same note when angry or\nwhen being brought his dinner, when lazily snapping flies, or when tearing an\nintruder to shreds. I liked, but didn\'t trust old Master; I wanted to please,\nbut did not trust the crowd. Then I looked at Brother Jack and grinned: That\nwas it; in some ways, he was like a toy bull terrier.\nBut now the roar and clapping of hands became a song and I saw\nBrother Jack break off and bounce to the door. "Okay, Brothers," he said,\n"that\'s our signal."\nWe went in a bunch, out of the dressing room and down a dim\npassage aroar with the distant sound. Then it was brighter and I could see a\nspotlight blazing the smoky haze. We moved silently, Brother Jack following\ntwo very black Negroes and two white men who led the procession, and now\nthe roar of the crowd seemed to rise above us, flaring louder. I noticed the\nothers falling into columns of four, and I was alone in the rear, like the pivot\nof a drill team. Ahead, a slanting shaft of brightness marked the entrance to\none of the levels of the arena, and now as we passed it the crowd let out a\nroar. Then swiftly we were in the dark again, and climbing, the roar seeming\nto sink below us and we were moved into a bright blue light and down a\nramp; to each side of which, stretching away in a curve, I could see rows of\nblurred faces -- then suddenly I was blinded and felt myself crash into the\nman ahead of me. "It always happens the first time," he shouted, stopping to\nlet me get my balance, his voice small in the roar. "It\'s the spotlight!"\nIt had picked us up now, and, beaming just ahead, led us into the\narena and encircled us full in its beam, the crowd thundering. The song burst\nforth like a rocket to the marching tempo of clapping hands:\nJohn Brown\'s body lies a-mold\'ring in the grave\nJohn Brown\'s body lies a-mold\'ring in the grave\nJohn Brown\'s body lies a-mold\'ring in the grave\n-- His soul is marching on!\nImagine that, I thought, they make the old song sound new. At first\nI was as remote as though I stood in the highest balcony looking on. Then I\nwalked flush into the vibrations of the voices and felt an electric tingling\nalong my spine. We marched toward a flag-draped platform set near the front\nof the arena, moving through an aisle left between rows of people in folding\nchairs, then onto the platform past a number of women who stood when we\ncame on. With a nod Brother Jack indicated our chairs and we faced the\napplause standing.\nBelow and above us was the audience, row after row of faces, the\narena a bowl-shaped aggregation of humanity. Then I saw the policemen and\nwas disturbed. What if they recognized me? They were all along the wall. I\ntouched the arm of the man ahead, seeing him turn, his mouth halting in a\nverse of the song.\n"Why all the police?" I said, leaning forward on the back of his\nchair.\n"Cops? Don\'t worry. Tonight they\'re ordered to protect us. This\nmeeting is of great political consequence!" he said, turning away.\nWho ordered them to protect us? I thought -- But now the song was\nending and the building rang with applause, yells, until the chant burst from\nthe rear and spread:\nNo more dispossessing of the dispossessed!\nNo more dispossessing of the dispossessed!\nThe audience seemed to have become one, its breathing and\narticulation synchronized. I looked at Brother Jack. He stood up front beside\na microphone, his feet planted solidly on the dirty canvas-covered platform,\nlooking from side to side; his posture dignified and benign, like a bemused\nfather listening to the performance of his adoring children. I saw his hand go\nup in a salute, and the audience thundered. And I seemed to move in close,\nlike the lens of a camera, focusing into the scene and feeling the heat and\nexcitement and the pounding of voice and applause against my diaphragm,\nmy eyes flying from face to face, swiftly, fleetingly, searching for someone I\ncould recognize, for someone from the old life, and seeing the faces become\nvaguer and vaguer the farther they receded from the platform.\nThe speeches began. First an invocation by a Negro preacher; then a\nwoman spoke of what was happening to the children. Then came speeches on\nvarious aspects of the economic and political situation. I listened carefully,\ntrying to snatch a phrase here, a word there, from the arsenal of hard,\nprecise terms. It was becoming a high-keyed evening. Songs flared between\nspeeches, chants exploded as spontaneously as shouts at a southern revival.\nAnd I was somehow attuned to it all, could feel it physically. Sitting with my\nfeet on the soiled canvas I felt as though I had wandered into the percussion\nsection of a symphony orchestra. It worked on me so thoroughly that I soon\ngave up trying to memorize phrases and simply allowed the excitement to\ncarry me along.\nSomeone pulled on my coat sleeve -- my turn had come. I went\ntoward the microphone where Brother Jack himself waited, entering the spot\nof light that surrounded me like a seamless cage of stainless steel. I halted.\nThe light was so strong that I could no longer see the audience, the bowl of\nhuman faces. It was as though a semi-transparent curtain had dropped\nbetween us, but through which they could see me -- for they were applauding\n-- without themselves being seen. I felt the hard, mechanical isolation of the\nhospital machine and I didn\'t like it. I stood, barely hearing Brother Jack\'s\nintroduction. Then he was through and there was an encouraging burst of\napplause. And I thought, They remember, some of them were there.\nThe microphone was strange and unnerving. I approached it\nincorrectly, my voice sounding raspy and full of air, and after a few words I\nhalted, embarrassed. I was getting off to a bad start, something had to be\ndone. I leaned toward the vague audience closest to the platform and said,\n"Sorry, folks. Up to now they\'ve kept me so far away from these shiny\nelectric gadgets I haven\'t learned the technique . . . And to tell you the truth,\nit looks to me like it might bite! Just look at it, it looks like the steel skull\nof a man! Do you think he died of dispossession?"\nIt worked and while they laughed someone came and made an\nadjustment. "Don\'t stand too close," he advised.\n"How\'s that?" I said, hearing my voice boom deep and vibrant over\nthe arena. "Is that better?"\nThere was a ripple of applause.\n"You see, all I needed was a chance. You\'ve granted it, now it\'s up\nto me!"\nThe applause grew stronger and from down front a man\'s far-carrying\nvoice called out, "We with you, Brother. You pitch \'em we catch \'em!"\nThat was all I needed, I\'d made a contact, and it was as though his\nvoice was that of them all. I was wound up, nervous. I might have been\nanyone, might have been trying to speak in a foreign language. For I couldn\'t\nremember the correct words and phrases from the pamphlets. I had to fall\nback upon tradition and since it was a political meeting, I selected one of the\npolitical techniques that I\'d heard so often at home: The old down-to-earth,\nI\'m-sick-and-tired-of-the-way-they\'ve-been-treating-us approach. I couldn\'t see\nthem so I addressed the microphone and the co-operative voice before me.\n"You know, there are those who think we who are gathered here are\ndumb," I shouted. "Tell me if I\'m right."\n"That\'s a strike, Brother," the voice called. "You pitched a strike."\n"Yes, they think we\'re dumb. They call us the \'common people.\' But\nI\'ve been sitting here listening and looking and trying to understand what\'s so\ncommon about us. I think they\'re guilty of a gross mis-statement of fact --\nwe are the uncommon people --"\n"Another strike," the voice called in the thunder, and I paused\nholding up my hand to halt the noise.\n"Yes, we\'re the uncommon people -- and I\'ll tell you why. They call\nus dumb and they treat us dumb. And what do they do with dumb ones?\nThink about it, look around! They\'ve got a slogan and a policy. They\'ve got\nwhat Brother Jack would call a \'theory and a practice.\' It\'s \'Never give a\nsucker an even break!\' It\'s dispossess him! Evict him! Use his empty head for\na spittoon and his back for a door mat! It\'s break him! Deprive him of his\nwages! It\'s use his protest as a sounding brass to frighten him into silence,\nit\'s beat his ideas and his hopes and homely aspirations, into a tinkling\ncymbal! A small, cracked cymbal to tinkle on the Fourth of July! Only muffle\nit! Don\'t let it sound too loud! Beat it in stoptime, give the dumb bunnies\nthe soft-shoe dance! The Big Wormy Apple, The Chicago Get Away, the Shoo\nFly Don\'t Bother Me!\n"And do you know what makes us so uncommon?" I whispered\nhoarsely. "We let them do it."\nThe silence was profound. The smoke boiled in the spotlight.\n"Another strike," I heard the voice call sadly. "Ain\'t no use to protest\nthe decision!" And I thought, Is he with me or against me?\n"Dispossession! Dis-possession is the word!" I went on. "They\'ve tried\nto dispossess us of our manhood and womanhood! Of our childhood and\nadolescence -- You heard the sister\'s statistics on our infant mortality rate.\nDon\'t you know you\'re lucky to be uncommonly born? Why, they even tried\nto dispossess us of our dislike of being dispossessed! And I\'ll tell you\nsomething else -- if we don\'t resist, pretty soon they\'ll succeed! These are the\ndays of dispossession, the season of homelessness, the time of evictions. We\'ll\nbe dispossessed of the very brains in our heads! And we\'re so uncommon\nthat we can\'t even see it! Perhaps we\'re too polite. Perhaps we don\'t care to\nlook at unpleasantness. They think we\'re blind -- uncommonly blind. And I\ndon\'t wonder. Think about it, they\'ve dispossessed us each of one eye from\nthe day we\'re born. So now we can only see in straight white lines. We\'re a\nnation of one-eyed mice -- Did you ever see such a sight in your life? Such\nan uncommon sight!"\n"An\' ain\'t a farmer\'s wife in the house," the voice called through the\ntitters of bitter laughter. "It\'s another strike!"\nI leaned forward. "You know, if we aren\'t careful, they\'ll slip up on\nour blind sides and -- plop! out goes our last good eye and we\'re blind as\nbats! Someone\'s afraid we\'ll see something. Maybe that\'s why so many of our\nfine friends are present tonight -- blue steel pistols and blue serge suits and\nall! -- but I believe one eye is enough to lose without resistance and I think\nthat\'s your belief. So let\'s get together. Did you ever notice, my dumb\none-eyed brothers, how two totally blind men can get together and help one\nanother along? They stumble, they bump into things, but they avoid dangers\ntoo; they get along. Let\'s get together, uncommon people. With both our eyes\nwe may see what makes us so uncommon, we\'ll see who makes us so\nuncommon! Up to now we\'ve been like a couple of one-eyed men walking\ndown opposite sides of the street. Someone starts throwing bricks and we\nstart blaming each other and fighting among ourselves. But we\'re mistaken!\nBecause there\'s a third party present. There\'s a smooth, oily scoundrel\nrunning down the middle of the wide gray street throwing stones -- He\'s the\none! He\'s doing the damage! He claims he needs the space -- he calls it his\nfreedom. And he knows he\'s got us on our blind side and he\'s been popping\naway till he\'s got us silly -- uncommonly silly! In fact, In fact, his freedom\nhas got us damn-nigh blind! Hush now, don\'t call no names!" I called,\nholding up my palm. "I say to hell with this guy! I say come on, cross over!\nLet\'s make an alliance! I\'ll look out for you, and you look out for me! I\'m\ngood at catching and I\'ve got a damn good pitching arm!"\n"You don\'t pitch no balls, Brother! Not a single one!"\n"Let\'s make a miracle," I shouted. "Let\'s take back our pillaged eyes!\nLet\'s reclaim our sight; let\'s combine and spread our vision. Peep around the\ncorner, there\'s a storm coming. Look down the avenue, there\'s only one\nenemy. Can\'t you see his face?"\nIt was a natural pause and there was applause, but as it burst I\nrealized that the flow of words had stopped. What would I do when they\nstarted to listen again? I leaned forward, straining to see through the barrier\nof light. They were mine, out there, and I couldn\'t afford to lose them. Yet I\nsuddenly felt naked, sensing that the words were returning and that\nsomething was about to be said that I shouldn\'t reveal.\n"Look at me!" The words ripped from my solar plexus. "I haven\'t\nlived here long. Times are hard, I\'ve known despair. I\'m from the South, and\nsince coming here I\'ve known eviction. I\'d come to distrust the world . . .\nBut look at me now, something strange is happening. I\'m here before you. I\nmust confess . . ."\nAnd suddenly Brother Jack was beside me, pretending to adjust the\nmicrophone. "Careful now," he whispered. "Don\'t end your usefulness before\nyou\'ve begun."\n"I\'m all right," I said, leaning toward the mike.\n"May I confess?" I shouted. "You are my friends. We share a\ncommon disinheritance, and it\'s said that confession is good for the soul.\nHave I your permission?"\n"Your batting .500, Brother," the voice called.\nThere was a stir behind me. I waited until it was quiet and hurried\non.\n"Silence is consent," I said, "so I\'ll have it out, I\'ll confess it!" My\nshoulders were squared, my chin thrust forward and my eyes focused straight\ninto the light. "Something strange and miraculous and transforming is taking\nplace in me right now . . . as I stand here before you!"\nI could feel the words forming themselves, slowly falling into place.\nThe light seemed to boil opalescently, like liquid soap shaken gently in a\nbottle.\n"Let me describe it. It is something odd. It\'s something that I\'m sure\nI\'d never experience anywhere else in the world. I feel your eyes upon me. I\nhear the pulse of your breathing. And now, at this moment, with your black\nand white eyes upon me, I feel . . . I feel . . ."\nI stumbled in a stillness so complete that I could hear the gears of\nthe huge clock mounted somewhere on the balcony gnawing upon time.\n"What is it, son, what do you feel?" a shrill voice cried.\nMy voice fell to a husky whisper, "I feel, I feel suddenly that I have\nbecome more human. Do you understand? More human. Not that I have\nbecome a man, for I was born a man. But that I am more human. I feel\nstrong, I feel able to get things done! I feel that I can see sharp and clear\nand far down the dim corridor of history and in it I can hear the footsteps\nof militant fraternity! No, wait, let me confess . . . I feel the urge to affirm\nmy feelings . . . I feel that here, after a long and desperate and uncommonly\nblind journey, I have come home . . . Home! With your eyes upon me I feel\nthat I\'ve found my true family! My true people! My true country! I am a new\ncitizen of the country of your vision, a native of your fraternal land. I feel\nthat here tonight, in this old arena, the new is being born and the vital old\nrevived. In each of you, in me, in us all.\n"SISTERS! BROTHERS!\n"WE ARE THE TRUE PATRIOTS! THE CITIZENS OF TOMORROW\'S\nWORLD!\n"WE\'LL BE DISPOSSESSED NO MORE!"\nThe applause struck like a clap of thunder. I stood, transfixed, unable\nto see, my body quivering with the roar. I made an indefinite movement.\nWhat should I do -- wave to them? I faced the shouts, cheers, shrill\nwhistling, my eyes burning from the light. I felt a large tear roll down my\nface and I wiped it away with embarrassment. Others were starting down.\nWhy didn\'t someone help me get out of the spot before I spoiled everything?\nBut with the tears came an increase of applause and I lifted my head,\nsurprised, my eyes streaming. The sound seemed to roar up in waves. They\nhad begun to stomp the floor and I was laughing and bowing my head now\nunashamed. It grew in volume, the sound of splitting wood came from the\nrear. I grew tired, but still they cheered until, finally, I gave up and started\nback toward the chairs. Red spots danced before my eyes. Someone took my\nhand, and leaned toward my ear.\n"You did it, goddamnit! You did it!" And I was puzzled by the hot\nmixture of hate and admiration bursting through his words as I thanked him\nand removed my hand from his crushing grasp.\n"Thanks," I said, "but the others had raised them to the right pitch."\nI shuddered; he sounded as though he would like to throttle me. I\ncouldn\'t see and there was much confusion and suddenly someone spun me\naround, pulling me off balance, and I felt myself pressed against warm\nfeminine softness, holding on.\n"Oh, Brother, Brother!" a woman\'s voice cried into my ear, "Little\nBrother!" and I felt the hot moist pressure of her lips upon my cheek.\nBlurred figures bumped about me. I stumbled as in a game of\nblindman\'s buff. My hands were shaken, my back pounded. My face was\nsprayed with the saliva of enthusiasm, and I decided that the next time I\nstood in the spotlight it would be wise to wear dark glasses.\nIt was a deafening demonstration. We left them cheering, knocking\nover chairs, stomping the floor. Brother Jack guided me off the platform. "It\'s\ntime we left," he shouted. "Things have truly begun to move. All that energy\nmust be organized!"\nHe guided me through the shouting crowd, hands continuing to touch\nme as I stumbled along. Then we entered the dark passage and when we\nreached the end the spots faded from my eyes and I began to see again.\nBrother Jack paused at the door.\n"Listen to them," he said. "Just waiting to be told what to do!" And\nI could still hear the applause booming behind us. Then several of the others\nbroke off their conversation and faced us, as the applause muffled down\nbehind the closing door.\n"Well, what do you think?" Brother Jack said enthusiastically. "How\'s\nthat for a starter?"\nThere was a tense silence. I looked from face to face, black and\nwhite, feeling swift panic. They were grim.\n"Well?" Brother Jack said, his voice suddenly hard.\nI could hear the creaking of someone\'s shoes.\n"Well?" he repeated.\nThen the man with the pipe spoke up, a swift charge of tension\nbuilding with his words.\n"It was a most unsatisfactory beginning," he said quietly, punctuating\nthe "unsatisfactory" with a stab of his pipe. He was looking straight at me\nand I was puzzled. I looked at the others. Their faces were noncommittal,\nstolid.\n"Unsatisfactory!" Brother Jack exploded. "And what alleged process of\nthought led to that brilliant pronouncement?"\n"This is no time for cheap sarcasm, Brother," the brother with the\npipe said.\n"Sarcasm? You made the sarcasm. No, it isn\'t a time for sarcasms\nnor for imbecilities. Nor for plain damn-fooleries! This is a key moment in\nthe struggle, things have just begun to move -- and suddenly you are\nunhappy. You are afraid of success? What\'s wrong? Isn\'t this just what we\'ve\nbeen working for?"\n"Again, ask yourself. You are the great leader. Look into your crystal\nball."\nBrother Jack swore.\n"Brothers!" someone said.\nBrother Jack swore and swung to another brother. "You," he said to\nthe husky man. "Have you the courage to tell me what\'s going on here? Have\nwe become a street-corner gang?"\nSilence. Someone shuffled his feet. The man with the pipe was\nlooking now at me.\n"Did I do something wrong?" I said.\n"The worst you could have done," he said coldly.\nStunned, I looked at him wordlessly.\n"Never mind," Brother Jack said, suddenly calm. "Just what is the\nproblem, Brother? Let\'s have it out right here. Just what is your complaint?"\n"Not a complaint, an opinion. If we are still allowed to express our\nopinions," the brother with the pipe said.\n"Your opinion, then," Brother Jack said.\n"In my opinion the speech was wild, hysterical, politically\nirresponsible and dangerous," he snapped. "And worse than that, it was\nincorrect!" He pronounced "incorrect" as though the term described the most\nheinous crime imaginable, and I stared at him open-mouthed, feeling a vague\nguilt.\n"Soooo," Brother Jack said, looking from face to face, "there\'s been a\ncaucus and decisions have been made. Did you take minutes, Brother\nChairman? Have you recorded your wise disputations?"\n"There was no caucus and the opinion still holds," the brother with\nthe pipe said.\n"No meeting, but just the same there has been a caucus and\ndecisions have been reached even before the event is finished."\n"But, Brother," someone tried to intervene.\n"A most brilliant, operation," Brother Jack went on, smiling now. "A\nconsummate example of skilled theoretical Nijinskys leaping ahead of history.\nBut come down. Brothers, come down or you\'ll land on your dialectics; the\nstage of history hasn\'t built that far. The month after next, perhaps, but not\nyet. And what do you think, Brother Wrestrum?" he asked, pointing to a big\nfellow of the shape and size of Supercargo.\n"I think the brother\'s speech was backward and reactionary!" he said.\nI wanted to answer but could not. No wonder his voice had sounded\nso mixed when he congratulated me. I could only stare into the broad face\nwith its hate-burning eyes.\n"And you," Brother Jack said.\n"I liked the speech," the man said, "I thought it was quite effective."\n"And you?" Brother Jack said to the next man.\n"I am of the opinion that it was a mistake."\n"And just why?"\n"Because we must strive to reach the people through their intelligence\n. . ."\n"Exactly," the brother with the pipe said. "It was the antithesis of the\nscientific approach. Ours is a reasonable point of view. We are champions of\na scientific approach to society, and such a speech as we\'ve identified\nourselves with tonight destroys everything that has been said before. The\naudience isn\'t thinking, it\'s yelling its head off."\n"Sure, it\'s acting like a mob," the big black brother said.\nBrother Jack laughed. "And this mob," he said, "Is it a mob against\nus, or is it a mob for us -- how do our muscle-bound scientists answer that?"\nBut before they could answer he continued, "Perhaps you\'re right,\nperhaps it is a mob; but if it is, then it seems to be a mob that\'s simply\nboiling over to come along with us. And I shouldn\'t have to tell you\ntheoreticians that science bases its judgments upon experiment! You\'re\njumping to conclusions before the experiment has run its course. In fact,\nwhat\'s happening here tonight represents only one step in the experiment.\nThe initial step, the release of energy. I can understand that it should make\nyou timid -- you\'re afraid of carrying through to the next step -- because it\'s\nup to you to organize that energy. Well, it\'s going to be organized and not by\na bunch of timid sideline theoreticians arguing in a vacuum, but by getting\nout and leading the people!"\nHe was fighting mad, looking from face to face, his red head\nbristling, but no one answered his challenge.\n"It\'s disgusting," he said, pointing to me. "Our new brother has\nsucceeded by instinct where for two years your \'science\' has failed, and now\nall you can offer is destructive criticism."\n"I beg to differ," the brother with the pipe said. "To point out the\ndangerous nature of his speech isn\'t destructive criticism. Far from it. Like\nthe rest of us, the new brother must learn to speak scientifically. He must be\ntrained!"\n"So at last it occurs to you," Brother Jack said, pulling down the\ncorners of his mouth. "Training. All is not lost. There\'s hope that our wild\nbut effective speaker may be tamed. The scientists perceive a possibility! Very\nwell, it has been arranged; perhaps not scientifically but arranged\nnevertheless. For the next few months our new brother is to undergo a period\nof intense study and indoctrination under the guidance of Brother Hambro.\nThat\'s right," he said, as I started to speak. "I meant to tell you later."\n"But that\'s a long time," I said. "How am I going to live?"\n"Your salary will continue," he said. "Meanwhile, you\'ll be guilty of\nno further unscientific speeches to upset our brothers\' scientific tranquillity. In\nfact, you are to stay completely out of Harlem. Perhaps then we\'ll see if you\nbrothers are as swift at organizing as you are at criticizing. It\'s your move,\nBrothers."\n"I think Brother Jack is correct," a short, bald man said. "And I\ndon\'t think that we, of all people, should be afraid of the people\'s\nenthusiasm. What we\'ve got to do is to guide it into channels where it will\ndo the most good."\nThe rest were silent, the brother with the pipe looking at me\nunbendingly.\n"Come," Brother Jack said. "Let\'s get out of here. If we keep our\neyes on the real goal our chances are better than ever before. And let\'s\nremember that science isn\'t a game of chess, although chess may be played\nscientifically. The other thing to remember is that if we are to organize the\nmasses we must first organize ourselves. Thanks to our new brother, things\nhave changed; we mustn\'t fail to make use of our opportunity. From now on\nit\'s up to you."\n"We shall see," the brother with the pipe said. "And as for the new\nbrother, a few talks with Brother Hambro wouldn\'t harm anyone."\nHambro, I thought, going out, who the hell is he? I suppose I\'m\nlucky they didn\'t fire me. So now I\'ve got to go to school again.\nOut in the night the group was breaking up and Brother Jack drew\nme aside. "Don\'t worry," he said. "You\'ll find Brother Hambro interesting, and\na period of training was inevitable. Your speech tonight was a test which you\npassed with flying colors, so now you\'ll be prepared for some real work.\nHere\'s the address; see Brother Hambro the first thing in the morning. He\'s\nalready been notified."\nWhen I reached home, tiredness seemed to explode within me. My\nnerves remained tense even after I had had a hot shower and crawled into\nbed. In my disappointment, I wanted only to sleep, but my mind kept\nwandering back to the rally. It had actually happened. I had been lucky and\nhad said the right things at the right time and they had liked me. Or perhaps\nI had said the wrong things in the right places -- whatever, they had liked it\nregardless of the brothers, and from now on my life would be different. It\nwas different already. For now I realized that I meant everything that I had\nsaid to the audience, even though I hadn\'t known that I was going to say\nthose things. I had intended only to make a good appearance, to say enough\nto keep the Brotherhood interested in me. What had come out was completely\nuncalculated, as though another self within me had taken over and held forth.\nAnd lucky that it had, or I might have been fired.\nEven my technique had been different; no one who had known me at\ncollege would have recognized the speech. But that was as it should have\nbeen, for I was someone new -- even though I had spoken in a very\nold-fashioned way. I had been transformed, and now, lying restlessly in bed\nin the dark, I felt a kind of affection for the blurred audience whose faces I\nhad never clearly seen. They had been with me from the first word. They had\nwanted me to succeed, and fortunately I had spoken for them and they had\nrecognized my words. I belonged to them. I sat up, grasping my knees in the\ndark as the thought struck home. Perhaps this was what was meant by being\n"dedicated and set aside." Very well, if so, I accepted it. My possibilities were\nsuddenly broadened. As a Brotherhood spokesman I would represent not only\nmy own group but one that was much larger. The audience was mixed, their\nclaims broader than race. I would do whatever was necessary to serve them\nwell. If they could take a chance with me, then I\'d do the very best that I\ncould. How else could I save myself from disintegration?\nI sat there in the dark trying to recall the sequence of the speech.\nAlready it seemed the expression of someone else. Yet I knew that it was\nmine and mine alone, and if it was recorded by a stenographer, I would have\na look at it tomorrow.\nWords, phrases skipped through my mind; I saw the blue haze again.\nWhat had I meant by saying that I had become "more human"? Was it a\nphrase that I had picked up from some preceding speaker, or a slip of the\ntongue? For a moment I thought of my grandfather and quickly dismissed\nhim. What had an old slave to do with humanity? Perhaps it was something\nthat Woodridge had said in the literature class back at college. I could see\nhim vividly, half-drunk on words and full of contempt and exaltation, pacing\nbefore the blackboard chalked with quotations from Joyce and Yeats and Sean\nO\'Casey; thin, nervous, neat, pacing as though he walked a high wire of\nmeaning upon which no one of us would ever dare venture. I could hear\nhim: "Stephen\'s problem, like ours, was not actually one of creating the\nuncreated conscience of his race, but of creating the uncreated features of his\nface. Our task is that of making ourselves individuals. The conscience of a\nrace is the gift of its individuals who see, evaluate, record . . . We create the\nrace by creating ourselves and then to our great astonishment we will have\ncreated something far more important: We will have created a culture. Why\nwaste time creating a conscience for something that doesn\'t exist? For, you\nsee, blood and skin do not think!"\nBut no, it wasn\'t Woodridge. "More human" . . . Did I mean that I\nhad become less of what I was, less a Negro, or that I was less a being\napart; less an exile from down home, the South? . . . But all this is negative.\nTo become less -- in order to become more? Perhaps that was it, but in what\nway more human? Even Woodridge hadn\'t spoken of such things. It was a\nmystery once more, as at the eviction I had uttered words that had possessed\nme.\nI thought of Bledsoe and Norton and what they had done. By kicking\nme into the dark they\'d made me see the possibility of achieving something\ngreater and more important than I\'d ever dreamed. Here was a way that\ndidn\'t lead through the back door, a way not limited by black and white, but\na way which, if one lived long enough and worked hard enough, could lead\nto the highest possible rewards. Here was a way to have a part in making\nthe big decisions, of seeing through the mystery of how the country, the\nworld, really operated. For the first time, lying there in the dark, I could\nglimpse the possibility of being more than a member of a race. It was no\ndream, the possibility existed. I had only to work and learn and survive in\norder to go to the top. Sure I\'d study with Hambro, I\'d learn what he had to\nteach and a lot more. Let tomorrow come. The sooner I was through with\nthis Hambro, the sooner I could get started with my work.\nChapter 17\nFour months later when Brother Jack called the apartment at\nmidnight to tell me to be prepared to take a ride I became quite excited.\nFortunately, I was awake and dressed, and when he drove up a few minutes\nlater I was waiting expectantly at the curb. Maybe, I thought, as I saw him\nhunched behind the wheel in his topcoat, this is what I\'ve been waiting for.\n"How have you been, Brother?" I said, getting in.\n"A little tired," he said. "Not enough sleep, too many problems."\nThen, as he got the car under way, he became silent, and I decided\nnot to ask any questions. That was one thing I had learned thoroughly. There\nmust be something doing at the Chthonian, I thought, watching him staring\nat the road as though lost in thought. Maybe the brothers are waiting to put\nme through my paces. If so, fine; I\'ve been waiting for an examination . . .\nBut instead of going to the Chthonian I looked out to discover that\nhe had brought me to Harlem and was parking the car.\n"We\'ll have a drink," he said, getting out and heading for where the\nneon-lighted sign of a bull\'s head announced the El Toro Bar.\nI was disappointed. I wanted no drink; I wanted to take the next\nstep that lay between me and an assignment. I followed him inside with a\nsurge of irritation.\nThe barroom was warm and quiet. The usual rows of bottles with\nexotic names were lined on the shelves, and in the rear, where four men\nargued in Spanish over glasses of beer, a juke box, lit up green and red,\nplayed "Media Luz." And as we waited for the bartender, I tried to figure the\npurpose of the trip.\nI had seen very little of Brother Jack after beginning my studies with\nBrother Hambro. My life had been too tightly organized. But I should have\nknown that if anything was going to happen, Brother Hambro would have let\nme know. Instead, I was to meet him in the morning as usual. That Hambro,\nI thought, is he a fanatic teacher! A tall, friendly man, a lawyer and the\nBrotherhood\'s chief theoretician, he had proved to be a hard taskmaster.\nBetween daily discussions with him and a rigid schedule of reading, I had\nbeen working harder than I\'d ever found necessary at college. Even my nights\nwere organized; every evening found me at some rally or meeting in one of\nthe many districts (though this was my first trip to Harlem since my speech)\nwhere I\'d sit on the platform with the speakers, making notes to be discussed\nwith him the next day. Every occasion became a study situation, even the\nparties that sometimes followed the meetings. During these I had to make\nmental notes on the ideological attitudes revealed in the guests\' conversations.\nBut I had soon learned the method in it: Not only had I been learning the\nmany aspects of the Brotherhood\'s policy and its approach to various social\ngroupings, but the city-wide membership had grown familiar with me. My\npart in the eviction was kept very much alive, and although I was under\norders to make no speeches, I had grown accustomed to being introduced as\na kind of hero.\nYet it had been mainly a time for listening and, being a talker, I had\ngrown impatient. Now I knew most of the Brotherhood arguments so well --\nthose I doubted as well as those I believed -- that I could repeat them in my\nsleep, but nothing had been said about my assignment. Thus I had hoped the\nmidnight call meant some kind of action was to begin . . .\nBeside me, Brother Jack was still lost in thought. He seemed in no\nhurry to go elsewhere or to talk, and as the slow-motion bartender mixed our\ndrinks I puzzled vainly as to why he had brought me here. Before me, in the\npanel where a mirror is usually placed, I could see a scene from a bullfight,\nthe bull charging close to the man and the man swinging the red cape in\nsculptured folds so close to his body that man and bull seemed to blend in\none swirl of calm, pure motion. Pure grace, I thought, looking above the bar\nto where, larger than life, the pink and white image of a girl smiled down\nfrom a summery beer ad on which a calendar said April One. Then, as our\ndrinks were placed before us, Brother Jack came alive, his mood changing as\nthough in the instant he had settled whatever had been bothering him and\nfelt suddenly free.\n"Here, come back," he said, nudging me playfully. "She\'s only a\ncardboard image of a cold steel civilization."\nI laughed, glad to hear him joking. "And that?" I said, pointing to\nthe bullfight scene.\n"Sheer barbarism," he said, watching the bartender and lowering his\nvoice to a whisper. "But tell me, how have you found your work with Brother\nHambro?"\n"Oh, fine," I said. "He\'s strict, but if I\'d had teachers like him in\ncollege, I\'d know a few things. He\'s taught me a lot, but whether enough to\nsatisfy the brothers who disliked my arena speech, I don\'t know. Shall we\nconverse scientifically?"\nHe laughed, one of his eyes glowing brighter than the other. "Don\'t\nworry about the brothers," he said. "You\'ll do very well. Brother Hambro\'s\nreports on you have been excellent."\n"Now, that\'s nice to hear," I.said, aware now of another bullfight\nscene further down the bar in which the matador was being swept skyward\non the black bull\'s horns. "I\'ve worked pretty hard trying to master the\nideology."\n"Master it," Brother Jack said, "but don\'t overdo it. Don\'t let it\nmaster you. There is nothing to put the people to sleep like dry ideology. The\nideal is to strike a medium between ideology and inspiration. Say what the\npeople want to hear, but say it in such a way that they\'ll do what we wish."\nHe laughed. "Remember too, that theory always comes after practice. Act first,\ntheorize later; that\'s also a formula, a devastatingly effective one!"\nHe looked at me as though he did not see me and I could not tell\nwhether he was laughing at me or with me. I was sure only that he was\nlaughing.\n"Yes," I said, "I\'ll try to master all that is required."\n"You can," he said. "And now you don\'t have to worry about the\nbrothers\' criticism. Just throw some ideology back at them and they\'ll leave\nyou alone -- provided, of course, that you have the right backing and produce\nthe required results. Another drink?"\n"Thanks, I\'ve had enough."\n"Are you sure?"\n"Sure."\n"Good. Now to your assignment: Tomorrow you are to become chief\nspokesman of the Harlem District . . ."\n"What!"\n"Yes. The committee decided yesterday."\n"But I had no idea."\n"You\'ll do all right. Now listen. You are to continue what you started\nat the eviction. Keep them stirred up. Get them active. Get as many to join\nas possible. You\'ll be given guidance by some of the older members, but for\nthe time being you are to see what you can do. You will have freedom of\naction -- and you will be under strict discipline to the committee."\n"I see," I said.\n"No, you don\'t quite see," he said, "but you will. You must not\nunderestimate the discipline, Brother. It makes you answerable to the entire\norganization for what you do. Don\'t underestimate the discipline. It is very\nstrict, but within its framework you are to have full freedom to do your work.\nAnd your work is very important. Understand?" His eyes seemed to crowd my\nface as I nodded yes. "We\'d better go now so that you can get some sleep,"\nhe said, draining his glass. "You\'re a soldier now, your health belongs to the\norganization."\n"I\'ll be ready," I said.\n"I know you will. Until tomorrow then. You\'ll meet with the executive\ncommittee of the Harlem section at nine A.M. You know the location of\ncourse?"\n"No, Brother, I don\'t."\n"Oh? That\'s right -- then you\'d better come up with me for a minute.\nI have to see someone there and you can take a look at where you\'ll work.\nI\'ll drop you off on the way down," he said.\nTHE district offices were located in a converted church structure, the\nmain floor of which was occupied by a pawn shop, its window crammed with\nloot that gleamed dully in the darkened street. We took a stair to the third\nfloor, entering a large room beneath a high Gothic ceiling.\n"It\'s down here," Brother Jack said, making for the end of the large\nroom where I saw a row of smaller ones, only one of which was lighted. And\nnow I saw a man appear in the door and limp forward.\n"Evening, Brother Jack," he said.\n"Why, Brother Tarp, I expected to find Brother Tobitt."\n"I know. He was here but he had to leave," the man said. "He left\nthis envelope for you and said he\'d call you later on tonight."\n"Good, good," Brother Jack said. "Here, meet a new brother . . ."\n"Pleased to meet you," the brother said, smiling. "I heard you speak\nat the arena. You really told \'em."\n"Thanks," I said.\n"So you liked it, did you, Brother Tarp?" Brother Jack said.\n"The boy\'s all right with me," the man said.\n"Well, you\'re going to see a lot of him, he\'s your new spokesman."\n"That\'s fine," the man said. "Looks like we\'re going to get some\nchanges made."\n"Correct," Brother Jack said. "Now let\'s take a look at his office and\nwe\'ll be going."\n"Sure, Brother," Tarp said, limping before me into one of the dark\nrooms and snapping on a light. "This here is the one."\nI looked into a small office, containing a flat-top desk with a\ntelephone, a typewriter on its table, a bookcase with shelves of books and\npamphlets, and a huge map of the world inscribed with ancient nautical signs\nand a heroic figure of Columbus to one side.\n"If there\'s anything you need, just see Brother Tarp," Brother Jack\nsaid. "He\'s here at all times."\n"Thanks, I shall," I said. "I\'ll get oriented in the morning."\n"Yes, and we\'d better go so you can get some sleep. Good night,\nBrother Tarp. See that everything is ready for him in the morning."\n"He won\'t have to worry about a thing, Brother. Good night."\n"It\'s because we attract men like Brother Tarp there that we shall\ntriumph," he said as we climbed into the car. "He\'s old physically, but\nideologically he\'s a vigorous young man. He can be depended upon in the\nmost precarious circumstance."\n"He sounds like a good man to have around," I said.\n"You\'ll see," he said and lapsed into a silence that lasted until we\nreached my door.\nTHE committee was assembled in the hall with the high Gothic\nceiling when I arrived, sitting in folding chairs around two small tables\npushed together to form a unit.\n"Well," Brother Jack said, "you are on time. Very good, we favor\nprecision in our leaders."\n"Brother, I shall always try to be on time," I said.\n"Here he is, Brothers and Sisters," he said, "your new spokesman.\nNow to begin. Are we all present?"\n"All except Brother Tod Clifton," someone said.\nHis red head jerked with surprise. "So?"\n"He\'ll be here," a young brother said. "We were working until three\nthis morning."\n"Still, he should be on time -- Very well," Brother Jack said, taking\nout a watch, "let us begin. I have only a little time here, but a little time is\nall that is needed. You all know the events of the recent period, and the role\nour new brother has played in them. Briefly, you are here to see that it isn\'t\nwasted. We must achieve two things: We must plan methods of increasing the\neffectiveness of our agitation, and we must organize the energy that has\nalready been released. This calls for a rapid increase of membership. The\npeople are fully aroused; if we fail to lead them into action, they will become\npassive, or they will become cynical. Thus it is necessary that we strike\nimmediately and strike hard!\n"For this purpose," he said, nodding toward me, "our brother has\nbeen appointed district spokesman. You are to give him your loyal support\nand regard him as the new instrument of the committee\'s authority . . ."\nI heard the slight applause splatter up -- only to halt with the\nopening of the door, and I looked down past the rows of chairs to where a\nhatless young man about my own age was coming into the hall. He wore a\nheavy sweater and slacks, and as the others looked up I heard the quick\nintake of a woman\'s pleasurable sigh. Then the young man was moving with\nan easy Negro stride out of the shadow into the light, and I saw that he was\nvery black and very handsome, and as he advanced mid-distance into the\nroom, that he possessed the chiseled, black-marble features sometimes found\non statues in northern museums and alive in southern towns in which the\nwhite offspring of house children and the black offspring of yard children\nbear names, features and character traits as identical as the rifling of bullets\nfired from a common barrel. And now close up, leaning tall and relaxed, his\narms outstretched stiffly upon the table, I saw the broad, taut span of his\nknuckles upon the dark grain of the wood, the muscular, sweatered arms, the\ncurving line of the chest rising to the easy pulsing of his throat, to the\nsquare, smooth chin, and saw a small X-shaped patch of adhesive upon the\nsubtly blended, velvet-over-stone, granite-over-bone, Afro-Anglo-Saxon contour\nof his cheek.\nHe leaned there, looking at us all with a remote aloofness in which I\nsensed an unstated questioning beneath a friendly charm. Sensing a possible\nrival, I watched him warily, wondering who he was.\n"Ah so, Brother Tod Clifton is late," Brother Jack said. "Our leader of\nthe youth is late. Why is this?"\nThe young man pointed to his cheek and smiled. "I had to see the\ndoctor," he said.\n"What is this?" Brother Jack said, looking at the cross of adhesive on\nthe black skin.\n"Just a little encounter with the nationalists. With Ras the Exhorter\'s\nboys," Brother Clifton said. And I heard a gasp from one of the women who\ngazed at him with shining, compassionate eyes.\nBrother Jack gave me a quick look. "Brother, you have heard of Ras?\nHe is the wild man who calls himself a black nationalist."\n"I don\'t recall so," I said.\n"You\'ll hear of him soon enough. Sit down, Brother Clifton; sit down.\nYou must be careful. You are valuable to the organization, you must not take\nchances."\n"This was unavoidable," the young man said.\n"Just the same," Brother Jack said, returning to the discussion with a\ncall for ideas.\n"Brother, are we still to fight against evictions?" I said.\n"It has become a leading issue, thanks to you."\n"Then why not step up the fight?"\nHe studied my face. "What do you suggest?"\n"Well, since it has attracted so much attention, why not try to reach\nthe whole community with the issue?"\n"And how would you suggest we go about it?"\n"I suggest we get the community leaders on record in support of us."\n"There are certain difficulties in face of this," Brother Jack said.\n"Most of the leaders are against us."\n"But I think he\'s got something there," Brother Clifton said. "What if\nwe got them to support the issue whether they like us or not? The issue is a\ncommunity issue, it\'s non-partisan."\n"Sure," I said, "that\'s how it looks to me. With all the excitement\nover evictions they can\'t afford to come out against us, not without appearing\nto be against the best interests of the community . . ."\n"So we have them across a barrel," Clifton said.\n"That is perceptive enough," Brother Jack said.\nThe others agreed.\n"You see," Brother Jack said with a grin, "we\'ve always avoided these\nleaders, but the moment we start to advance on a broad front, sectarianism\nbecomes a burden to be cast off. Any other suggestions?" He looked around.\n"Brother," I said, remembering now, "when I first came to Harlem\none of the first things that impressed me was a man making a speech from a\nladder. He spoke very violently and with an accent, but he had an\nenthusiastic audience . . . Why can\'t we carry our program to the street in\nthe same way?"\n"So you have met him," he said, suddenly grinning. "Well, Ras the\nExhorter has had a monopoly in Harlem. But now that we are larger we\nmight give it a try. What the committee wants is results!"\nSo that was Ras the Exhorter, I thought.\n"We\'ll have trouble with the Extortor -- I mean the Exhorter," a big\nwoman said. "His hoodlums would attack and denounce the white meat of a\nroasted chicken."\nWe laughed.\n"He goes wild when he sees black people and white people together,"\nshe said to me.\n"We\'ll take care of that," Brother Clifton said, touching his cheek.\n"Very well, but no violence," Brother Jack said. "The Brotherhood is\nagainst violence and terror and provocation of any kind -- aggressive, that is.\nUnderstand, Brother Clifton?"\n"I understand," he said.\n"We will not countenance any aggressive violence. Understand? Nor\nattacks upon officials or others who do not attack us. We are against all\nforms of violence, do you understand?"\n"Yes, Brother," I said.\n"Very well, having made this clear I leave you now," he said. "See\nwhat you can accomplish. You\'ll have plenty support from other districts and\nall the guidance you need. Meanwhile, remember that we are all under\ndiscipline."\nHe left and we divided the labor. I suggested that each work in the\narea he knew best. Since there was no liaison between the Brotherhood and\nthe community leaders I assigned myself the task of creating one. It was\ndecided that our street meetings begin immediately and that Brother Tod\nClifton was to return and go over the details with me.\nWhile the discussion continued I studied their faces. They seemed\nabsorbed with the cause and in complete agreement, blacks and whites. But\nwhen I tried to place them as to type I got nowhere. The big woman who\nlooked like a southern "sudsbuster" was in charge of women\'s work, and\nspoke in abstract, ideological terms. The shy-looking man with the liver\nsplotches on his neck spoke with a bold directness and eagerness for action.\nAnd this Brother Tod Clifton, the youth leader, looked somehow like a\nhipster, a zoot suiter, a sharpie -- except his head of Persian lamb\'s wool had\nnever known a straightener. I could place none of them. They seemed familiar\nbut were just as different as Brother Jack and the other whites were from all\nthe white men I had known. They were all transformed, like familiar people\nseen in a dream. Well, I thought, I\'m different too, and they\'ll see it when\nthe talk is finished and the action begins. I\'ll just have to be careful not to\nantagonize anyone. As it is, someone might resent my being placed in charge.\nBut when Brother Tod Clifton came into my office to discuss the\nstreet meeting I saw no signs of resentment, but a complete absorption in the\nstrategy of the meeting. With great care he went about instructing me how to\ndeal with hecklers, on what to do if we were attacked, and upon how to\nrecognize our own members from the rest of the crowd. For all his seeming\nzoot-suiter characteristics his speech was precise and I had no doubt that he\nknew his business.\n"How do you think we\'ll do?" I said when he had finished.\n"It\'ll go big, man," he said. "It\'ll be bigger than anything since\nGarvey."\n"I wish I could be so sure," I said. "I never saw Garvey."\n"I didn\'t either," he said, "but I understand that in Harlem he was\nvery big."\n"Well, we\'re not Garvey, and he didn\'t last."\n"No, but he must have had something," he said with sudden passion.\n"He must have had something to move all those people! Our people are hell\nto move. He must have had plenty!"\nI looked at him. His eyes were turned inward; then he smiled. "Don\'t\nworry," he said. "We have a scientific plan and you set them off. Things are\nso bad they\'ll listen, and when they listen they\'ll go along."\n"I hope so," I said.\n"They will. You haven\'t been around the movement as I have, for\nthree years now, and I can feel the change. They\'re ready to move."\n"I hope your feelings are right," I said.\n"They\'re right, all right," he said. "All we have to do is gather them\nin."\nTHE evening was almost of a winter coldness, the corner well lighted\nand the all-Negro crowd large and tightly packed. Up on the ladder now I\nwas surrounded by a group of Clifton\'s youth division, and I could see,\nbeyond their backs with upturned collars, the faces of the doubtful, the\ncurious and the convinced in the crowd. It was early and I threw my voice\nhard down against the traffic sounds, feeling the damp coldness of the air\nupon my cheeks and hands as my voice warmed with my emotion. I had just\nbegun to feel the pulsing set up between myself and the people, hearing them\nanswering in staccato applause and agreement when Tod Clifton caught my\neye, pointing. And over the heads of the crowd and down past the dark\nstorefronts and blinking neon signs I saw a bristling band of about twenty\nmen quick-stepping forward. I looked down.\n"It\'s trouble, keep talking," Clifton said. "Give the boys the signal."\n"My Brothers, the time has come for action," I shouted. And now I\nsaw the youth members and some older men move around to the back of the\ncrowd, and up to meet the advancing group. Then something sailed up out of\nthe dark and landed hard against my forehead, and I felt the crowd surge in\nclose, sending the ladder moving backwards, and I was like a man tottering\nabove a crowd on stilts, then dropping backwards into the street and clear,\nhearing the ladder clatter down. They were milling in a panic now, and I saw\nClifton beside me. "It\'s Ras the Exhorter," he yelled. "Can you use your\nhands?"\n"I can use my fists!" I was annoyed.\n"Well, all right then. Here\'s your chance. Come on, let\'s see you\nduke!"\nHe moved forward and seemed to dive into the whirling crowd, and\nI beside him, seeing them scatter into doorways and pound off in the dark.\n"There\'s Ras, over there," Clifton cried. And I heard the sound of\nbreaking glass and the street went dark. Someone had knocked out the light,\nand through the dimness I saw Clifton heading to where a red neon sign\nglowed in a dark window as something went past my head. Then a man ran\nup with a length of pipe and I saw Clifton close with him, ducking down and\nworking in close and grabbing the man\'s wrist and twisting suddenly like a\nsoldier executing an about-face so that now he faced me, the back of the\nman\'s elbow rigid across his shoulder and the man rising on tiptoe and\nscreaming as Clifton straightened smoothly and levered down on the arm.\nI heard a dry popping sound and saw the man sag, and the pipe\nrang upon the walk; then someone caught me hard in the stomach and\nsuddenly I knew that I was fighting too. I went to my knees and rolled and\npulled erect, facing him. "Get up, Uncle Tom," he said, and I clipped him. He\nhad his hands and I had mine and the match was even but he was not so\nlucky. He wasn\'t down and he wasn\'t out, but I caught him two good ones\nand he decided to fight elsewhere. When he turned I tripped him and moved\naway.\nThe fight was moving back into the dark where the street lights had\nbeen knocked out clear to the corner, and it was quiet except for the\ngrunting and straining and the sound of footfalls and of blows. It was\nconfusing in the dark and I couldn\'t tell ours from theirs and moved\ncautiously, trying to see. Someone up the street in the dark yelled, "Break it\nup! Break it up!" and I thought, Cops, and looked around for Clifton. The\nneon sign glowed mysteriously and there was a lot of running and cursing,\nand now I saw him working skillfully in a store lobby before a red CHECKS\nCASHED HERE sign and I hurried over, hearing objects sailing past my head\nand the crash of glass. Clifton\'s arms were moving in short, accurate jabs\nagainst the head and stomach of Ras the Exhorter, punching swiftly and\nscientifically, careful not to knock him into the window or strike the glass\nwith his fists, working Ras between rights and lefts jabbed so fast that he\nrocked like a drunken bull, from side to side. And as I came up Ras tried to\nbull his way out and I saw Clifton drive him back and down into a squat, his\nhands upon the dark floor of the lobby, his heels back against the door like a\nrunner against starting blocks. And now, shooting forward, he caught Clifton\ncoming in, butting him, and I heard the burst of breath and Clifton was on\nhis back and something flashed in Ras\'s hand and he came forward, a short,\nheavy figure as wide as the lobby now with the knife, moving deliberately. I\nspun, looking for the length of pipe, diving for it and crawling on hands and\nknees and here, here -- and coming up to see Ras reach down, getting one\nhand into Clifton\'s collar, the knife in the other, looking down at Clifton and\npanting, bull-angry. I froze, seeing him draw back the knife and stop it in\nmid-air; draw back and stop, cursing; then draw back and stop again, all very\nquickly, beginning to cry now and talking rapidly at the same time; and me\neasing slowly forward.\n"Mahn," Ras blurted, "I ought to kill you. Godahm, I ought to kill\nyou and the world be better off. But you black, mahn. Why you be black,\nmahn? I swear I ought to kill you. No mahn strike the Exhorter, godahmit,\nno mahn!"\nI saw him raise the knife again and now as he lowered it unused he\npushed Clifton into the street and stood over him, sobbing.\n"Why you with these white folks? Why? I been watching you a long\ntime. I say to myself, \'Soon he get smart and get tired. He get out of that\nt\'ing.\' Why a good boy like you still with them?"\nStill moving forward, I saw his face gleam with red angry tears as he\nstood above Clifton with the still innocent knife and the tears red in the glow\nof the window sign.\n"You my brother, mahn. Brothers are the same color; how the hell\nyou call these white men brother? Shit, mahn. That\'s shit! Brothers the same\ncolor. We sons of Mama Africa, you done forgot? You black, BLACK! You --\nGodahm, mahn!" he said, swinging the knife for emphasis. "You got bahd\nhair! You got thick lips! They say you stink! They hate you, mahn. You\nAfrian. AFRICAN! Why you with them? Leave that shit, mahn. They sell you\nout. That shit is old-fashioned. They enslave us -- you forget that? How can\nthey mean a black mahn any good? How they going to be your brother?"\nI had reached him now and brought the pipe down hard, seeing the\nknife fly off into the\' dark as he grabbed his wrist, and I raised the pipe\nagain, suddenly hot with fear and hate, as he looked at me out of his narrow\nlittle eyes, standing his ground.\n"And you, mahn," the Exhorter said, "a reg\'lar little black devil! A\ngodahm sly mongoose! Where you think you from, going with the white folks?\nI know, godahm; don\'t I know it! You from down South! You from Trinidad!\nYou from Barbados! Jamaica, South Africa, and the white mahn\'s foot in your\nass all the way to the hip. What you trying to deny by betraying the black\npeople? Why you fight against us? You young fellows. You young black men\nwith plenty education; I been hearing your rabble rousing. Why you go over\nto the enslaver? What kind of education is that? What kind of black mahn is\nthat who betray his own mama?"\n"Shut up," Clifton said, leaping to his feet. "Shut up!"\n"Hell, no," Ras cried, wiping his eyes with his fists. "I talk! Bust me\nwith the pipe but, by God, you listen to the Exhorter! Come in with us,\nmahn. We build a glorious movement of black people. Black People! What\nthey do, give you money? Who wahnt the dahm stuff? Their money bleed\nblack blood, mahn. It\'s unclean! Taking their money is shit, mahn. Money\nwithout dignity -- That\'s bahd shit!"\nClifton lunged toward him. I held him, shaking my head. "Come on,\nthe man\'s crazy," I said, pulling on his arm.\nRas struck his thighs with his fists. "Me crazy, mahn? You call me\ncrazy? Look at you two and look at me -- is this sanity? Standing here in\nthree shades of blackness! Three black men fighting in the street because of\nthe white enslaver? Is that sanity? Is that consciousness, scientific\nunderstahnding? Is that the modern black mahn of the twentieth century?\nHell, mahn! Is it self-respect -- black against black? What they give you to\nbetray -- their women? You fall for that?"\n"Let\'s go," I said, listening and remembering and suddenly alive in\nthe dark with the horror of the battle royal, but Clifton looked at Ras with a\ntight, fascinated expression, pulling away from me.\n"Let\'s go," I repeated. He stood there, looking.\n"Sure, you go," Ras said, "but not him. You contahminated but he\nthe real black mahn. In Africa this mahn be a chief, a black king! Here they\nsay he rape them godahm women with no blood in their veins. I bet this\nmahn can\'t beat them off with baseball bat -- shit! What kind of foolishness\nis it? Kick him ass from cradle to grave then call him brother? Does it make\nmahthematics? Is it logic? Look at him, mahn; open your eyes," he said to\nme. "I look like that I rock the blahsted world! They know about me in\nJapan, India -- all the colored countries. Youth! Intelligence! The mahn\'s a\nnatural prince! Where is your eyes? Where your self-respect? Working for\nthem dahm people? Their days is numbered, the time is almost here and you\nfooling \'round like this was the nineteenth century. I don\'t understahnd you.\nAm I ignorant? Answer me, mahn!"\n"Yes," Clifton burst out. "Hell, yes!"\n"You t\'ink I\'m crazy, is it c\'ase I speak bahd English? Hell, it ain\'t\nmy mama tongue, mahn, I\'m African! You really t\'ink I\'m crazy?"\n"Yes, yes!"\n"You believe that?" said Ras. "What they do to you, black mahn?\nGive you them stinking women?"\nClifton lunged again, and again I grabbed him; and again Ras held\nhis ground, his head glowing red.\n"Women? Godahm, mahn! Is that equality? Is that the black mahn\'s\nfreedom? A pat on the back and a piece of cunt without no passion?\nMaggots! They buy you that blahsted cheap, mahn? What they do to my\npeople! Where is your brains? These women dregs, mahn! They bilge water!\nYou know the high-class white mahn hates the black mahn, that\'s simple. So\nnow he use the dregs and wahnt you black young men to do his dirty work.\nThey betray you and you betray the black people. They tricking you, mahn.\nLet them fight among themselves. Let \'em kill off one another. We organize --\norganization is good -- but we organize black. BLACK! To hell with that son\nof a bitch! He take one them strumpets and tell the black mahn his freedom\nlie between her skinny legs -- while that son of a gun, he take all the power\nand the capital and don\'t leave the black mahn not\'ing. The good white\nwomen he tell the black mahn is a rapist and keep them locked up and\nignorant while he makes the black mahn a race of bahstards.\n"When the black mahn going to tire of this childish perfidity? He got\nyou so you don\'t trust your black intelligence? You young, don\'t play you\'self\ncheap, mahn. Don\'t deny you\'self! It took a billion gallons of black blood to\nmake you. Recognize you\'self inside and you wan the kings among men! A\nmahn knows he\'s a mahn when he got not\'ing, when he\'s naked -- nobody\nhave to tell him that. You six foot tall, mahn. You young and intelligent. You\nblack and beautiful -- don\'t let \'em tell you different! You wasn\'t them t\'ings\nyou be dead, mahn. Dead! I\'d have killed you, mahn. Ras the Exhorter raised\nup his knife and tried to do it, but he could not do it. Why don\'t you do it?\nI ask myself. I will do it now, I say; but somet\'ing tell me, \'No, no! You\nmight be killing your black king!\' And I say, yas, yas! So I accept your\nhumiliating ahction. Ras recognized your black possibilities, mahn. Ras would\nnot sahcrifice his black brother to the white enslaver. Instead he cry. Ras is a\nmahn -- no white mahn have to tell him that -- and Ras cry. So why don\'t\nyou recognize your black duty, mahn, and come jine us?"\nHis chest was heaving and a note of pleading had come into the\nharsh voice. He was an exhorter, all right, and I was caught in the crude,\ninsane eloquence of his plea. He stood there, awaiting an answer. And\nsuddenly a big transport plane came low over the buildings and I looked up\nto see the firing of its engine, and we were all three silent, watching.\nSuddenly the Exhorter shook his fist toward the plane and yelled,\n"Hell with him, some day we have them too! Hell with him!"\nHe stood there, shaking his fist as the plane rattled the buildings in\nits powerful flight. Then it was gone and I looked about the unreal street.\nThey were fighting far up the block in the dark now and we were alone. I\nlooked at the Exhorter. I didn\'t know if I was angry or amazed.\n"Look," I said, shaking my head, "let\'s talk sense. From now on we\'ll\nbe on the street corners every night and we\'ll be prepared for trouble. We\ndon\'t want it, especially with you, but we won\'t run either . . ."\n"Goddam, mahn," he said, leaping forward, "this is Harlem. This is\nmy territory, the black mahn\'s territory. You think we let white folks come in\nand spread their poison? Let \'em come in like they come and take over the\nnumbers racket? Like they have all the stores? Talk sense, mahn, if you\ntalking to Ras, talk sense!"\n"This is sense," I said, "and you listen as we listened to you. We\'ll\nbe out here every night, understand. We\'ll be out here and the next time you\ngo after one of our brothers with a knife -- and I mean white or black --\nwell, we won\'t forget it."\nHe shook his head, "Nor will I forget you either, mahn."\n"Don\'t. I don\'t want you to; because if you forget there\'ll be trouble.\nYou\'re mistaken, don\'t you see you\'re outnumbered? You need allies to win . .\n."\n"That there is sense. Black allies. Yellow and brown allies!"\n"All men who want a brotherly world," I said.\n"Don\'t be stupid, mahn. They white, they don\'t have to be allies with\nno black people. They get what they wahnt, they turn against you. Where\'s\nyour black intelligence?"\n"Thinking like that will get you lost in the backwash of history," I\nsaid. "Start thinking with your mind and not your emotions."\nHe shook his head vehemently, looking at Clifton.\n"This black mahn talking to me about brains and thinking. I ask\nboth of you, are you awake or sleeping? What is your pahst and where are\nyou going? Never mind, take your corrupt ideology and eat out your own guts\nlike a laughing hyena. You are nowhere, mahn. Nowhere! Ras is not ignorant,\nnor is Ras afraid. No! Ras, he be here black and fighting for the liberty of\nthe black people when the white folks have got what they wahnt and done\ngone off laughing in your face and you stinking and choked up with white\nmaggots."\nHe spat angrily into the dark street. It flew pink in the red glow.\n"That\'ll be all right with me," I said. "Only remember what I said.\nCome on, Brother Clifton. This man\'s full of pus, black pus."\nWe started away, a piece of glass crunching under my foot.\n"Maybe so," Ras said, "but I ahm no fool! I ahm no black educated\nfool who t\'inks everything between black mahn and white mahn can be\nsettled with some blahsted lies in some bloody books written by the white\nmahn in the first place. It\'s three hundred years of black blood to build this\nwhite mahn\'s civilization and wahn\'t be wiped out in a minute. Blood calls\nfor blood! You remember that. And remember that I am not like you. Ras\nrecognizes the true issues and he is not afraid to be black. Nor is he a\ntraitor for white men. Remember that: I am no black traitor to the black\npeople for the white people."\nAnd before I could answer Clifton spun in the dark and there was a\ncrack and I saw Ras go down and Clifton breathing hard and Ras lying there\nin the street, a thick, black man with red tears on his face that caught the\nreflection of the CHECKS CASHED HERE sign.\nAnd again, as Clifton looked gravely down he seemed to ask a silent\nquestion.\n"Let\'s go," I said. "Let\'s go!"\nWe started away as the screams of sirens sounded, Clifton cursing\nquietly to himself.\nThen we were out of the dark onto a busy street and he turned to\nme. There were tears in his eyes.\n"That poor, misguided son of a bitch," he said.\n"He thinks a lot of you, too," I said. I was glad to be out of the\ndark and away from that exhorting voice.\n"The man\'s crazy," Clifton said. "It\'ll run you crazy if you let it."\n"Where\'d he get that name?" I said.\n"He gave it to himself. I guess he did. Ras is a title of respect in the\nEast. It\'s a wonder he didn\'t say something about \'Ethiopia stretching forth\nher wings,\' " he said, mimicking Ras. "He makes it sound like the hood of a\ncobra fluttering . . . I don\'t know . . . I don\'t know . . ."\n"We\'ll have to watch him now," I said.\n"Yes, we\'d better," he said. "He won\'t stop fighting . . . And thanks\nfor getting rid of his knife."\n"You didn\'t have to worry," I said. "He wouldn\'t kill his king."\nHe turned and looked at me as though he thought I might mean it;\nthen he smiled.\n"For a while there I thought I was gone," he said.\nAs we headed for the district office I wondered what Brother Jack\nwould say about the fight.\n"We\'ll have to overpower him with organization," I said.\n"We\'ll do that, all right. But it\'s on the inside that Ras is strong,"\nClifton said. "On the inside he\'s dangerous."\n"He won\'t get on the inside," I said. "He\'d consider himself a traitor."\n"No," Clifton said, "he won\'t get on the inside. Did you hear how he\nwas talking? Did you hear what he was saying?"\n"I heard him, sure," I said.\n"I don\'t know," he said. "I suppose sometimes a man has to plunge\noutside history . . ."\n"What?"\n"Plunge outside, turn his back . . . Otherwise he might kill\nsomebody, go nuts."\nI didn\'t answer. Maybe he\'s right, I thought, and was suddenly very\nglad I had found Brotherhood.\nTHE next morning it rained and I reached the district before the\nothers arrived and stood looking through the window of my office, past the\njutting wall of a building, and on beyond the monotonous pattern of its\nbricks and mortar I saw a row of trees rising tall and graceful in the rain.\nOne tree grew close by and I could see the rain streaking its bark and its\nsticky buds. Trees were rowed the length of the long block beyond me, rising\ntall in dripping wetness above a series of cluttered backyards. And it occurred\nto me that cleared of its ramshackle fences and planted with flowers and\ngrass, it might form a pleasant park. And just then a paper bag sailed from a\nwindow to my left and burst like a silent grenade, scattering garbage into the\ntrees and pancaking to earth with a soggy, exhausted plop! I started with\ndisgust, then thought, The sun will shine in those backyards some day. A\ncommunity clean-up campaign might be worthwhile for a slack season, at\nthat. Everything couldn\'t possibly be as exciting as last night.\nTurning back to my desk I sat facing the map now as Brother Tarp\nappeared.\n"Morning, son, I see you already on the job," he said.\n"Good morning. I have so much to do that I thought I\'d better get\nstarted early," I said.\n"You\'ll do all right," he said. "But I didn\'t come in here to take up\nyour time, I want to put something on the wall."\n"Go right ahead. Can I give you a hand?"\n"No, I can make it all right," he said, clambering with his lame leg\nupon a chair that sat beneath the map and hanging a frame from the ceiling\nmolding, straightening it carefully, and getting down to come over beside my\ndesk.\n"Son, you know who that is?"\n"Why, yes," I said, "it\'s Frederick Douglass."\n"Yessir, that\'s just who it is. You know much about him?"\n"Not much. My grandfather used to tell me about him though."\n"That\'s enough. He was a great man. You just take a look at him\nonce in a while. You have everything you need -- paper and stuff like that?"\n"Yes, I have, Brother Tarp. And thanks for the portrait of Douglass."\n"Don\'t thank me, son," he said from the door. "He belongs to all of\nus."\nI sat now facing the portrait of Frederick Douglass, feeling a sudden\npiety, remembering and refusing to hear the echoes of my grandfather\'s voice.\nThen I picked up the telephone and began calling the community leaders.\nThey fell in line like prisoners: preachers, politicians, various\nprofessionals, proving Clifton correct. The eviction fight was such a dramatic\nissue that most of the leaders feared that their followers would have rallied to\nus without them. I slighted no one, no matter how unimportant; bigshots,\ndoctors, real-estate men and store-front preachers. And it went so fast and\nsmoothly that it seemed not to happen to me but to someone who actually\nbore my new name. I almost laughed into the phone when I heard the\ndirector of Men\'s House address me with profound respect. My new name\nwas getting around. It\'s very strange, I thought, but things are so unreal for\nthem normally that they believe that to call a thing by name is to make it\nso. And yet I am what they think I am . . .\nOUR work went so well that a few Sundays later we threw a parade\nthat clinched our hold on the community. We worked feverishly. And now the\nclashing and conflict of my last days at Mary\'s seemed to have moved out\ninto the struggles of the community, leaving me inwardly calm and controlled.\nEven the hustle and bustle of picketing and speechmaking seemed to\nstimulate me for the better; my wildest ideas paid off.\nUpon hearing that one of the unemployed brothers was an ex-drill\nmaster from Wichita, Kansas, I organized a drill team of six-footers whose\nduty it was to march through the streets striking up sparks with their\nhobnailed shoes. On the day of the parade they drew crowds faster than a\ndogfight on a country road. The People\'s Hot Foot Squad, we called them,\nand when they drilled fancy formations down Seventh Avenue in the\nspringtime dusk they set the streets ablaze. The community laughed and\ncheered and the police were dumfounded. But the sheer corn of it got them\nand the Hot Foot Squad went shuffling along. Then came the flags and\nbanners and the cards bearing slogans; and the squad of drum majorettes, the\nbest-looking girls we could find, who pranced and twirled and just plain\ngirled in the enthusiastic interest of Brotherhood. We pulled fifteen thousand\nHarlemites into the street behind our slogans and marched down Broadway to\nCity Hall. Indeed, we were the talk of the town.\nWith this success I was pushed forward at a dizzy pace. My name\nspread like smoke in an airless room. I was kept moving all over the place.\nSpeeches here, there, everywhere, uptown and down. I wrote newspaper\narticles, led parades and relief delegations, and so on. And the Brotherhood\nwas going out of its way to make my name prominent. Articles, telegrams\nand many mailings went out over my signature -- some of which I\'d written,\nbut most not. I was publicized, identified with the organization both by word\nand image in the press. On the way to work one late spring morning I\ncounted fifty greetings from people I didn\'t know, becoming aware that there\nwere two of me: the old self that slept a few hours a night and dreamed\nsometimes of my grandfather and Bledsoe and Brockway and Mary, the self\nthat flew without wings and plunged from great heights; and the new public\nself that spoke for the Brotherhood and was becoming so much more\nimportant than the other that I seemed to run a foot race against myself.\nStill, I liked my work during those days of certainty. I kept my eyes\nwide and ears alert. The Brotherhood was a world within a world and I was\ndetermined to discover all its secrets and to advance as far as I could. I saw\nno limits, it was the one organization in the whole country in which I could\nreach the very top and I meant to get there. Even if it meant climbing a\nmountain of words. For now I had begun to believe, despite all the talk of\nscience around me, that there was a magic in spoken words. Sometimes I sat\nwatching the watery play of light upon Douglass\' portrait, thinking how\nmagical it was that he had talked his way from slavery to a government\nministry, and so swiftly. Perhaps, I thought, something of the kind is\nhappening to me. Douglass came north to escape and find work in the\nshipyards; a big fellow in a sailor\'s suit who, like me, had taken another\nname. What had his true name been? Whatever it was, it was as Douglass\nthat he became himself, defined himself. And not as a boatwright as he\'d\nexpected, but as an orator. Perhaps the sense of magic lay in the unexpected\ntransformations. "You start Saul, and end up Paul," my grandfather had often\nsaid. "When you\'re a youngun, you Saul, but let life whup your head a bit\nand you starts to trying to be Paul -- though you still Sauls around on the\nside."\nNo, you could never tell where you were going, that was a sure\nthing. The only sure thing. Nor could you tell how you\'d get there -- though\nwhen you arrived it was somehow right. For hadn\'t I started out with a\nspeech, and hadn\'t it been a speech that won my scholarship to college,\nwhere I had expected speechmaking to win me a place with Bledsoe and\nlaunch me finally as a national leader? Well, I had made a speech, and it\nhad made me a leader, only not the kind I had expected. So that was the\nway it was. And no complaints, I thought, looking at the map; you started\nlooking for red men and you found them -- even though of a different tribe\nand in a bright new world. The world was strange if you stopped to think\nabout it; still it was a world that could be controlled by science, and the\nBrotherhood had both science and history under control.\nThus for one lone stretch of time I lived with the intensity displayed\nby those chronic numbers players who see clues to their fortune in the most\nminute and insignificant phenomena: in clouds, on passing trucks and subway\ncars, in dreams, comic strips, the shape of dog-luck fouled on the pavements.\nI was dominated by the all-embracing idea of Brotherhood. The organization\nhad given the world a new shape, and me a vital role. We recognized no\nloose ends, everything could be controlled by our science. Life was all pattern\nand discipline; and the beauty of discipline is when it works. And it was\nworking very well.\nChapter 18\nOnly my Bledsoe-trustee inspired compulsion to read all papers that\ntouched my hands prevented me from throwing the envelope aside. It was\nunstamped and appeared to be the least important item in the morning\'s\nmail:\nBrother,\nThis is advice from a friend who has been watching you closely. Do\nnot go too fast. Keep working for the people but remember that you are one\nof us and do not forget if you get too big they will cut you down. You are\nfrom the South and you know that this is a white man\'s world. So take a\nfriendly advice and go easy so that you can keep on helping the colored\npeople. They do not want you to go too fast and will cut you down if you\ndo. Be smart . . .\nI shot to my feet, the paper rattling poisonously in my hands. What\ndid it mean? Who\'d send such a thing?\n"Brother Tarp!" I called, reading again the wavery lines of a\nhandwriting that was somehow familiar. "Brother Tarp!"\n"What is it, son?"\nAnd looking up, I received another shock. Framed there in the gray,\nearly morning light of the door, my grandfather seemed to look from his\neyes. I gave a quick gasp, then there was a silence in which I could hear his\nwheezing breath as he eyed me unperturbed.\n"What\'s wrong?" he said, limping into the room.\nI reached for the envelope. "Where did this come from?" I said.\n"What is it?" he said, taking it calmly from my hands.\n"It\'s unstamped."\n"Oh, yes -- I saw it myself," he said. "I reckon somebody put it in\nthe box late last night. I took it out with the regular mail. Is it something\nthat wasn\'t for you?"\n"No," I said, avoiding his eyes. "But -- it isn\'t dated. I was wondering\nwhen it arrived -- Why are you staring at me?"\n"Because looks to me like you seen a ghost. You feel sick?"\n"It\'s nothing," I said. "Just a slight upset."\nThere was an awkward silence. He stood there and I forced myself to\nlook at his eyes again, finding my grandfather gone, leaving only the\nsearching calm. I said, "Sit down a second, Brother Tarp. Since you\'re here\nI\'d like to ask you a question."\n"Sure," he said, dropping into a chair. "Go \'head."\n"Brother Tarp, you get around and know the members -- how do\nthey really feel about me?"\nHe cocked his head. "Why, sure -- they think you\'re going to make a\nreal leader --"\n"But?"\n"Ain\'t no buts, that\'s what they think and I don\'t mind telling you."\n"But what about the others?"\n"What others?"\n"The ones who don\'t think so much of me?"\n"Them\'s the ones I haven\'t heard about, son."\n"But I must have some enemies," I said.\n"Sure, I guess everybody has \'em, but I never heard of anybody here\nin the Brotherhood not liking you. As far as folks up here is concerned they\nthink you\'re it. You heard any different?"\n"No, but I was wondering. I\'ve been going along taking them so\nmuch for granted that I thought I\'d better check so that I can keep their\nsupport."\n"Well, you don\'t have to worry. So far, nearly everything you had\nanything to do with has turned out to be what the folks like, even things\nsome of \'em resisted. Take that there," he said, pointing to the wall near my\ndesk.\nIt was a symbolic poster of a group of heroic figures: An American\nIndian couple, representing the dispossessed past; a blond brother (in\noveralls) and a leading Irish sister, representing the dispossessed present; and\nBrother Tod Clifton and a young white couple (it had been felt unwise simply\nto show Clifton and the girl) surrounded by a group of children of mixed\nraces, representing the future, a color photograph of bright skin texture and\nsmooth contrast.\n"So?" I said, staring at the legend:\n"After the Struggle: The Rainbow of America\'s Future"\n"Well, when you first suggested it, some of the members was against\nyou."\n"That\'s certainly true."\n"Sho, and they raised the devil about the youth members going into\nthe subways and sticking \'em up in place of them constipation ads and things\n-- but do you know what they doing now?"\n"I guess they\'re holding it against me because some of the kids were\narrested," I said.\n"Holding it against you? Hell, they going around bragging about it.\nBut what I was about to say is they taking them rainbow pictures and\ntacking \'em to their walls \'long with \'God Bless Our Home\' and the Lord\'s\nPrayer. They\'re crazy about it. And same way with the Hot-Footers and all\nthat. You don\'t have to worry, son. They might resist some of your ideas, but\nwhen the deal goes down, they with you right on down to the ground. The\nonly enemies you likely to have is somebody on the outside who\'s jealous to\nsee you spring up all of a sudden and start to doing some of the things what\nshould of been done years ago. And what do you care when some folks start\nknocking you? It\'s a sign you getting some place."\n"I\'d like to believe so, Brother Tarp," I said. "As long as I have the\npeople with me I\'ll believe in what I\'m doing."\n"That\'s right," he said. "When things get rough it kind of helps to\nknow you got support --" His voice broke off and he seemed to stare down\nat me, although he faced me at eye level acrosis the desk.\n"What is it, Brother Tarp?"\n"You from down South, ain\'t you, son?"\n"Yes," I said.\nHe turned in his chair, sliding one hand into his pocket as he rested\nhis chin upon the other. "I don\'t really have the words to say what just come\ninto my head, son. You see, I was down there for a long time before I come\nup here, and when I did come up they was after me. What I mean is, I had\nto escape, I had to come a-running."\n"I guess I did too, in a way," I said.\n"You mean they were after you too?"\n"Not really, Brother Tarp, I just feel that way."\n"Well this ain\'t exactly the same thing," he said. "You notice this\nlimp I got?"\n"Yes."\n"Well, I wasn\'t always lame, and I\'m not really now \'cause the\ndoctors can\'t find anything wrong with that leg. They say it\'s sound as a\npiece of steel. What I mean is I got this limp from dragging a chain."\nI couldn\'t see it in his face or hear it in his speech, yet I knew he\nwas neither lying nor trying to shock me. I shook my head.\n"Sure," he said. "Nobody knows that about me, they just think I got\nrheumatism. But it was that chain and after nineteen years I haven\'t been\nable to stop dragging my leg."\n"Nineteen years!"\n"Nineteen years, six months and two days. And what I did wasn\'t\nmuch; that is, it wasn\'t much when I did it. But after all that time it\nchanged into something else and it seemed to be as bad as they said it was.\nAll that time made it bad. I paid for it with everything I had but my life. I\nlost my wife and my boys and my piece of land. So what started out as an\nargument between a couple of men turned out to be a crime worth nineteen\nyears of my life."\n"What on earth did you do, Brother Tarp?"\n"I said no to a man who wanted to take something from me; that\'s\nwhat it cost me for saying no and even now the debt ain\'t fully paid and will\nnever be paid in their terms."\nA pain throbbed in my throat and I felt a kind of numb despair.\nNineteen years! And here he was talking quietly to me and this no doubt the\nfirst time he\'d tried to tell anyone about it. But why me, I thought, why pick\nme?\n"I said no," he said. "I said hell, no! And I kept saying no until I\nbroke the chain and left."\n"But how?"\n"They let me get close to the dogs once in a while, that\'s how. I\nmade friends with them dogs and I waited. Down there you really learn how\nto wait. I waited nineteen years and then one morning when the river was\nflooding I left. They thought I was one of them who got drowned when the\nlevee broke, but I done broke the chain and gone. I was standing in the mud\nholding a long-handled shovel and I asked myself, Tarp, can you make it?\nAnd inside me I said yes; all that water and mud and rain said yes, and I\ntook off."\nSuddenly he gave a laugh so gay it startled me.\n"I\'m tellin\' it better\'n I ever thought I could," he said, fishing in his\npocket and removing something that looked like an oilskin tobacco pouch,\nfrom which he removed an object wrapped in a handkerchief.\n"I\'ve been looking for freedom ever since, son. And sometimes I\'ve\ndone all right. Up to these here hard times I did very well, considering that\nI\'m a man whose health is not too good. But even when times were best for\nme I remembered. Because I didn\'t want to forget those nineteen years I just\nkind of held on to this as a keepsake and a reminder."\nHe was unwrapping the object now and I watched his old man\'s\nhands.\n"I\'d like to pass it on to you, son. There," he said, handing it to me.\n"Funny thing to give somebody, but I think it\'s got a heap of signifying\nwrapped up in it and it might help you remember what we\'re really fighting\nagainst. I don\'t think of it in terms of but two words, yes and no; but it\nsignifies a heap more . . ."\nI saw him place his hand on the desk. "Brother," he said, calling me\n"Brother" for the first time, "I want you to take it. I guess it\'s a kind of luck\npiece. Anyway, it\'s the one I filed to get away."\nI took it in my hand, a thick, dark, oily piece of filed steel that had\nbeen twisted open and forced partly back into place, on which I saw marks\nthat might have been made by the blade of a hatchet. It was such a link as I\nhad seen on Bledsoe\'s desk, only while that one had been smooth, Tarp\'s\nbore the marks of haste and violence, looking as though it had been attacked\nand conquered before it stubbornly yielded.\nI looked at him and shook my head as he watched me inscrutably.\nFinding no words to ask him more about it, I slipped the link over my\nknuckles and struck it sharply against the desk.\nBrother Tarp chuckled. "Now there\'s a way I never thought of using\nit," he said. "It\'s pretty good. It\'s pretty good."\n"But why do you give it to me, Brother Tarp?"\n"Because I have to, I guess. Now don\'t go trying to get me to say\nwhat I can\'t. You\'re the talker, not me," he said, getting up and limping\ntoward the door. "It was lucky to me and I think it might be lucky to you.\nYou just keep it with you and look at it once in a while. Course, if you get\ntired of it, why, give it back."\n"Oh, no," I called after him, "I want it and I think I understand.\nThanks for giving it to me."\nI looked at the dark band of metal against my fist and dropped it\nupon the anonymous letter. I neither wanted it nor knew what to do with it;\nalthough there was no question of keeping it if for no other reason than that\nI felt that Brother Tarp\'s gesture in offering it was of some deeply felt\nsignificance which I was compelled to respect. Something, perhaps, like a man\npassing on to his son his own father\'s watch, which the son accepted not\nbecause he wanted the old-fashioned time-piece for itself, but because of the\novertones of unstated seriousness and solemnity of the paternal gesture which\nat once joined him with his ancestors, marked a high point of his present,\nand promised a concreteness to his nebulous and chaotic future. And now I\nremembered that if I had returned home instead of coming north my father\nwould have given me my grandfather\'s old-fashioned Hamilton, with its long,\nburr-headed winding stem. Well, so my brother would get it and I\'d never\nwanted it anyway. What were they doing now, I brooded, suddenly sick for\nhome.\nI could feel the air from the window hot against my neck now as\nthrough the smell of morning coffee I heard a throaty voice singing with a\nmixture of laughter and solemnity:\nDon\'t come early in the morning\nNeither in the heat of the day\nBut come in the sweet cool of the\nEvening and wash my sins away . . .\nA whole series of memories started to well up, but I threw them off. There\nwas no time for memory, for all its images were of times passed.\nThere had been only a few minutes from the time that I\'d called in\nBrother Tarp about the letter and his leaving, but it seemed as though I\'d\nplunged down a well of years. I looked calmly now at the writing which, for\na moment, had shaken my total structure of certainty, and was glad that\nBrother Tarp had been there to be called rather than Clifton or some of the\nothers before whom I would have been ashamed of my panic. Instead he\'d\nleft me soberly confident. Perhaps from the shock of seeming to see my\ngrandfather looking through Tarp\'s eyes, perhaps through the calmness of his\nvoice alone, or perhaps through his story and his link of chain, he had\nrestored my perspective.\nHe\'s right, I thought; whoever sent the message is trying to confuse\nme; some enemy is trying to halt our progress by destroying my faith through\ntouching upon my old southern distrust, our fear of white betrayal. It was as\nthough he had learned of my experience with Bledsoe\'s letters and was trying\nto use that knowledge to destroy not only me but the whole Brotherhood. Yet\nthat was impossible; no one knew that story who knew me now. It was\nsimply an obscene coincidence. If only I could get my hands upon his stupid\nthroat. Here in the Brotherhood was the one place in the country where we\nwere free and given the greatest encouragement to use our abilities, and he\nwas trying to destroy it! No, it wasn\'t me he was worrying about becoming\ntoo big, it was the Brotherhood. And becoming big was exactly what the\nBrotherhood wanted. Hadn\'t I just received orders to submit ideas for\norganizing more people? And "a white man\'s world" was just what the\nBrotherhood was against. We were dedicated to building a world of\nBrotherhood.\nBut who had sent it -- Ras the Exhorter? No, it wasn\'t like him. He\nwas more direct and absolutely against any collaboration between blacks and\nwhites. It was someone else, someone more insidious than Ras. But who, I\nwondered, forcing it below my consciousness as I turned to the tasks at hand.\nThe morning began with people asking my advice on how to secure\nrelief; members coming in for instructions for small committee meetings being\nheld in corners of the large hall; and I had just dismissed a woman seeking\nto free her husband, who had been jailed for beating her, when Brother\nWrestrum entered the room. I returned his greeting and watched him ease\ninto a chair, his eyes sweeping over my desk-with uneasiness. He seemed to\npossess some kind of authority in the Brotherhood, but his exact function was\nunclear. He was, I felt, something of a meddler.\nAnd hardly had he settled himself when he stared at my desk,\nsaying, "What you got there, Brother?" and pointed toward a pile of my\npapers.\nI leaned slowly back in my chair, looking him in the eye. "That\'s my\nwork," I said coldly, determined to stop any interference from the start.\n"But I mean that," he said, pointing, his eyes beginning to blaze,\n"that there."\n"It\'s work," I said, "all my work."\n"Is that too?" he said, pointing to Brother Tarp\'s leg link.\n"That\'s just a personal present, Brother," I said. "What could I do for\nyou?"\n"That ain\'t what I asked you, Brother. What is it?"\nI picked up the link and held it toward him, the metal oily and\nstrangely skinlike now with the slanting sun entering the window. "Would you\ncare to examine it, Brother? One of our members wore it nineteen years on\nthe chain gang."\n"Hell, no!" He recoiled. "I mean, no, thank you. In fact, Brother, I\ndon\'t think we ought to have such things around!"\n"You think so," I said. "And just why?"\n"Because I don\'t think we ought to dramatize our differences."\n"I\'m not dramatizing anything, it\'s my personal property that happens\nto be lying on my desk."\n"But people can see it!"\n"That\'s true," I said. "But I think it\'s a good reminder of what our\nmovement is fighting against."\n"No, suh!" he said, shaking his head, "no, suh! That\'s the worse kind\nof thing for Brotherhood -- because we want to make folks think of the\nthings we have in common. That\'s what makes for Brotherhood. We have to\nchange this way we have of always talking about how different we are. In the\nBrotherhood we are all brothers."\nI was amused. He was obviously disturbed by something deeper than\na need to forget differences. Fear was in his eyes. "I never thought of it in\njust that way, Brother," I said, dangling the iron between my finger and\nthumb.\n"But you want to think about it," he said. "We have to discipline\nourselves. Things that don\'t make for Brotherhood have to be rooted out. We\nhave enemies, you know. I watch everything I do and say so as to be sure\nthat I don\'t upset the Brotherhood -- \'cause this is a wonderful movement,\nBrother, and we have to keep it that way. We have to watch ourselves,\nBrother. You know what I mean? Too often we\'re liable to forget that this is\nsomething that\'s a privilege to belong to. We\'re liable to say things that don\'t\ndo nothing but make for more misunderstanding."\nWhat\'s driving him, I thought, what\'s all this to do with me? Could\nhe have sent me the note? Dropping the iron I fished the anonymous note\nfrom beneath the pile and held it by a corner, so that the slanting sun shone\nthrough the page and outlined the scrawling letters. I watched him intently.\nHe was leaning upon the desk now, looking at the page but with no\nrecognition in his eyes. I dropped the page upon the chain, more\ndisappointed than relieved.\n"Between you and me, Brother," he said, "there are those amongst us\nwho don\'t really believe in Brotherhood."\n"Oh?"\n"You damn right they don\'t! They\'re just in it to use it for their own\nends. Some call you Brother to your face and the minute you turn your back,\nyou\'re a black son of a bitch! You got to watch \'em."\n"I haven\'t encountered any of that, Brother," I said.\n"You will. There\'s lots of poison around. Some don\'t want to shake\nyour hand and some don\'t like the idea of seeing too much of you; but\ngoddam it, in the Brotherhood they gotta!"\nI looked at him. It had never occurred to me that the Brotherhood\ncould force anyone to shake my hand, and that he found satisfaction that it\ncould was both shocking and distasteful.\nSuddenly he laughed. "Yes, dammit, they gotta! Me, I don\'t let \'em\nget away with nothing. If they going to be brothers let \'em be brothers! Oh,\nbut I\'m fair," he said, his face suddenly self-righteous. "I\'m fair. I ask myself\nevery day, \'What are you doing against Brotherhood?\' and when I find it, I\nroot it out, I burn it out like a man cauterizing a mad-dog bite. This\nbusiness of being a brother is a full-time job. You have to be pure in heart,\nand you have to be disciplined in body and mind. Brother, you understand\nwhat I mean?"\n"Yes, I think I do," I said. "Some folks feel that way about their\nreligion."\n"Religion?" He blinked his eyes. "Folks like me and you is full of\ndistrust," he said. "We been corrupted \'til it\'s hard for some of us to believe\nin Brotherhood. And some even want revenge! That\'s what I\'m talking about.\nWe have to root it out! We have to learn to trust our other brothers. After\nall, didn\'t they start the Brotherhood? Didn\'t they come and stretch out their\nhand to us black men and say, \'We want y\'all for our brothers?\' Didn\'t they\ndo it? Didn\'t they, now? Didn\'t they set out to organize us, and help fight\nour battle and all like that? Sho they did, and we have to remember it\ntwenty-four hours a day. Brotherhood. That\'s the word we got to keep right\nin front of our eyes every second. Now this brings me to why I come to see\nyou, Brother."\nHe sat back, his huge hands grasping his knees. "I got a plan I want\nto talk over with you."\n"What is it, Brother?" I said.\n"Well, it\'s like this. I think we ought to have some way of showing\nwhat we are. We ought to have some banners and things like that. Specially\nfor us black brothers."\n"I see," I said, becoming interested. "But why do you think this is\nimportant?"\n" \'Cause it helps the Brotherhood, that\'s why. First, if you remember,\nwhen you watch our people when there\'s a parade or a funeral, or a dance or\nanything like that, they always have some kind of flags and banners even if\nthey don\'t mean anything. It kind of makes the occasion seem more\nimportant like. It makes people stop look and listen. \'What\'s coming off here?\'\nBut you know and I know that they ain\'t none of \'em got no true flag --\nexcept maybe Ras the Exhorter, and he claims he\'s Ethiopian or African. But\nnone of us got no true flag \'cause that flag don\'t really belong to us. They\nwant a true flag, one that\'s as much theirs as anybody else\'s. You know what\nI mean?"\n"Yes, I think I do," I said, remembering that there was always that\nsense in me of being apart when the flag went by. It had been a reminder,\nuntil I\'d found the Brotherhood, that my star was not yet there . . .\n"Sure, you know," Brother Wrestrum said. "Everybody wants a flag.\nWe need a flag that stands for Brotherhood, and we need a sign we can\nwear."\n"A sign?"\n"You know, a pin or a button."\n"You mean an emblem?"\n"That\'s it! Something we can wear, a pin or something like that. So\nthat when a Brother meets a Brother they can know it. That way that thing\nwhat happened to Brother Tod Clifton wouldn\'t have happened . . ."\n"What wouldn\'t have happened?"\nHe sat back. "Don\'t you know about it?"\n"I don\'t know what you mean."\n"It\'s something that\'s best forgot about," he said, leaning close, his\nbig hands gripped and stretched before him. "But you see, there was a rally\nand some hoodlums tried to break up the meeting, and in the fighting\nBrother Tod Clifton got holt to one of the white brothers by mistake and was\nbeating him, thought he was one of the hoodlums, he said. Things like that is\nbad, Brother, very bad. But with some of these emblems, things like that\nwouldn\'t happen."\n"So that actually happened," I said.\n"Sure did. That Brother Clifton goes wild when he gits mad . . . But\nwhat do you think of my idea?"\n"I think it should be brought to the attention of the committee," I\nsaid guardedly, as the phone rang. "Excuse me a moment, Brother," I said.\nIt was the editor of a new picture magazine requesting an interview\nof "one of our most successful young men."\n"That\'s very flattering," I said, "but I\'m afraid I\'m too busy for an\ninterview. I suggest, however, that you interview our youth leader, Brother\nTod Clifton; you\'ll find him a much more interesting subject."\n"No, no!" Wrestrum said, shaking his head violently as the editor\nsaid, "But we want you. You\'ve --"\n"And you know," I interrupted, "our work is considered very\ncontroversial, certainly by some."\n"That\'s exactly why we want you. You\'ve become identified with that\ncontroversy and it\'s our job to bring such subjects to the eyes of our\nreaders."\n"But so has Brother Clifton," I said.\n"No, sir; you\'re the man and you owe it to our youth to allow us to\ntell them your story," he said, as I watched Brother Wrestrum leaning\nforward. "We feel that they should be encouraged to keep fighting toward\nsuccess. After all, you\'re one of the latest to fight his way to the top. We\nneed all the heroes we can get."\n"But, please," I laughed over the phone, "I\'m no hero and I\'m far\nfrom the top; I\'m a cog in a machine. We here in the Brotherhood work as a\nunit," I said, seeing Brother Wrestrum nod his head in agreement.\n"But you can\'t get around the fact that you\'re the first of our people\nto attract attention to it, can you now?"\n"Brother Clifton was active at least three years before me. Besides, it\nisn\'t that simple. Individuals don\'t count for much; it\'s what the group wants,\nwhat the group does. Everyone here submerges his personal ambitions for the\ncommon achievement."\n"Good! That\'s very good. People want to hear that. Our people need\nto have someone say that to them. Why don\'t you let me send out an\ninterviewer? I\'ll have her there in twenty minutes."\n"You\'re very insistent, but I\'m very busy," I said.\nAnd if Brother Wrestrum hadn\'t been wig-wagging, trying to tell me\nwhat to say I would have refused. Instead, I consented. Perhaps, I thought, a\nlittle friendly publicity wouldn\'t hurt. Such a magazine would reach many\ntimid souls living far from the sound of our voices. I had only to remember\nto say little about my past.\n"I\'m sorry for this interruption, Brother," I said, putting down the\nphone and looking into his curious eyes. "I\'ll bring your idea to the attention\nof the committee as quickly as possible."\nI stood to discourage further talk and he got up, fairly bursting to\ncontinue.\n"Well, I\'ve got to see some other brothers myself," he said, "I\'ll be\nseeing you soon."\n"Anytime," I said, avoiding his hand by picking up some papers.\nGoing out, he turned with his hand on the door frame, frowning.\n"And, Brother, don\'t forget what I said about that thing you got on your\ndesk. Things like that don\'t do nothin\' but cause confusion. They ought to be\nkept out of sight."\nI was glad to see him go. The idea of his trying to tell me what to\nsay in a conversation only part of which he could have heard! And it was\nobvious that he disliked Clifton. Well, I disliked him. And all that foolishness\nand fear over the leg chain. Tarp had worn it for nineteen years and could\nlaugh, but this big --\nThen I forgot Brother Wrestrum until about two weeks later at our\ndowntown headquarters, where a meeting had been called to discuss strategy.\nEVERYONE had arrived before me. Long benches were arranged at\none side of the room, which was hot and filled with smoke. Usually such\nmeetings sounded like a prizefight or a smoker, but now everyone was silent.\nThe white brothers looked uncomfortable and some of the Harlem brothers\nbelligerent. Nor did they leave me time to think about it. No sooner had I\napologized for my lateness than Brother Jack struck the table with his gavel,\naddressing his first remarks to me.\n"Brother, there seems to be a serious misunderstanding among some\nof the brothers concerning your work and recent conduct," he said.\nI stared at him blankly, my mind groping for connections. "I\'m sorry,\nBrother Jack," I said, "but I don\'t understand. You mean there\'s something\nwrong with my work?"\n"So it seems," he said, his face completely neutral. "Certain charges\nhave just been made . . ."\n"Charges? Have I failed to carry out some directive?"\n"About that there seems to be some doubt. But we\'d better let\nBrother Wrestrum speak of this," he said.\n"Brother Wrestrum!"\nI was shocked. He hadn\'t been around since our talk, and I looked\nacross the table into his evasive face, seeing him stand with a slouch, a rolled\npaper protruding from his pocket.\n"Yes, Brothers," he said, "I brought charges, much as I hated to have\nto do it. But I been watching the way things have been going and I\'ve\ndecided that if they don\'t stop soon, this brother is going to make a fool out\nof the Brotherhood!"\nThere were some sounds of protest.\n"Yes, I said it and I mean it! This here brother constitutes one of\nthe greatest dangers ever confronted by our movement."\nI looked at Brother Jack; his eyes were sparkling. I seemed to see\ntraces of a smile as he scribbled something on a pad. I was becoming very\nhot.\n"Be more specific, Brother," Brother Garnett, a white brother, said.\n"These are serious charges and we all know that the brother\'s work has been\nsplendid. Be specific."\n"Sho, I\'ll be specific," Wrestrum boomed, suddenly whipping the\npaper from his pocket, unrolling it and throwing it on the table. "This here\'s\nwhat I mean!"\nI took a step forward; it was a portrait of me looking out from a\nmagazine page.\n"Where did that come from?" I said.\n"That\'s it," he boomed. "Make out like you never seen it."\n"But I haven\'t," I said. "I really haven\'t."\n"Don\'t lie to these white brothers. Don\'t lie!"\n"I\'m not lying. I never saw it before in my life. But suppose I had,\nwhat\'s wrong with it?"\n"You know what\'s wrong!" Wrestrum said.\n"Look, I don\'t know anything. What\'s on your mind? You have us all\nhere, so if you have anything to say, please get it over with."\n"Brothers, this man is a -- a -- opportunist! All you got to do is read\nthis article to see. I charge this man with using the Brotherhood movement\nto advance his own selfish interests."\n"Article?" Then I remembered the interview which I had forgotten. I\nmet the eyes of the others as they looked from me to Wrestrum.\n"And what does it say about us?" Brother Jack said, pointing to the\nmagazine.\n"Say?" Wrestrum said. "It doesn\'t say anything. It\'s all about him.\nWhat he thinks, what he does; what he\'s going to do. Not a word about the\nrest of us who\'s been building the movement before he was ever heard of.\nLook at it, if you think I\'m lying. Look at it!"\nBrother Jack turned to me. "Is this true?"\n"I haven\'t read it," I said. "I had forgotten that I was interviewed."\n"But you remember it now?" Brother Jack said.\n"Yes, I do now. And he happened to be in the office when the\nappointment was made."\nThey were silent.\n"Hell, Brother Jack," Wrestrum said, "it\'s right here in black and\nwhite. He\'s trying to give people the idea that he\'s the whole Brotherhood\nmovement."\n"I\'m doing nothing of the sort. I tried to get the editor to interview\nBrother Tod Clifton, you know that. Since you know so little about what I\'m\ndoing, why not tell the brothers what you\'re up to."\n"I\'m exposing a double-dealer, that\'s what I\'m doing. I\'m exposing\nyou. Brothers, this man is a pure dee opportunist!"\n"All right," I said, "expose me if you can, but stop the slander."\n"I\'ll expose you, all right," he said, sticking out his chin. "I\'m going\nto. He\'s doing everything I said, Brothers. And I\'ll tell you something else --\nhe\'s trying to sew things up so that the members won\'t move unless he tells\nthem to. Look at a few weeks ago when he was off in Philly. We tried to get\na rally going and what happens? Only about two hundred people turned out.\nHe\'s trying to train them so they won\'t listen to no one but him."\n"But, Brother, didn\'t we decide that the appeal had been improperly\nphrased?" a brother interrupted.\n"Yeah, I know, but that wasn\'t it . . ."\n"But the committee analyzed the appeal and --"\n"I know, Brothers, and I don\'t aim to dispute the committee. But,\nBrothers, it just seems that way \'cause you don\'t know this man. He works in\nthe dark, he\'s got some kind of plot . . ."\n"What kind of plot?" one of the brothers said, leaning across the\ntable.\n"Just a plot," Wrestrum said. "He aims to control the movement\nuptown. He wants to be a dictator!"\nThe room was silent except for the humming of fans. They looked at\nhim with a new concern.\n"These are very serious charges, Brother," two brothers said in\nunison.\n"Serious? I know they\'re serious. That\'s how come I brought them.\nThis opportunist thinks that because he\'s got a little more education he\'s\nbetter than anybody else. He\'s what Brother Jack calls a petty -- petty\nindividualist!"\nHe struck the conference table with his fist, his eyes showing small\nand round in his taut face. I wanted to punch that face. It no longer seemed\nreal, but a mask behind which the real face was probably laughing, both at\nme and at the others. For he couldn\'t believe what he had said. It just wasn\'t\npossible. He was the plotter and from the serious looks on the committee\'s\nfaces he was getting away with it. Now several brothers started to speak at\nonce, and Brother Jack knocked for order.\n"Brothers, please!" Brother Jack said. "One at a time. What do you\nknow about this article?" he said to me.\n"Not very much," I said. "The editor of the magazine called to say he\nwas sending a reporter up for an interview. The reporter asked a few\nquestions and took a few pictures with a little camera. That\'s all I know."\n"Did you give the reporter a prepared handout?"\n"I gave her nothing except a few pieces of our official literature. I\ntold her neither what to ask me nor what to write. I naturally tried to\nco-operate. If an article about me would help make friends for the movement\nI felt it was my duty."\n"Brothers, this thing was arranged," Wrestrum said. "I tell you this\nopportunist had that reporter sent up there. He had her sent up and he told\nher what to write."\n"That\'s a contemptible lie," I said. "You were present and you know I\ntried to get them to interview Brother Clifton!"\n"Who\'s a lie?"\n"You\'re a liar and a fat-mouthed scoundrel. You\'re a liar and no\nbrother of mine."\n"Now he\'s calling me names. Brothers, you heard him."\n"Let\'s not lose our tempers," Brother Jack said calmly. "Brother\nWrestrum, you\'ve made serious charges. Can you prove them?"\n"I can prove them. All you have to do is read the magazine and\nprove them for yourself;"\n"It will be read. And what else?"\n"All you have to do is listen to folks in Harlem. All they talk about\nis him. Never nothing about what the rest of us do. I tell you, Brothers, this\nman constitutes a danger to the people of Harlem. He ought to be thrown\nout!"\n"That is for the committee to decide," Brother Jack said. Then to me,\n"And what have you to say in your defense, Brother?"\n"In my defense?" I said, "Nothing. I haven\'t anything to defend. I\'ve\ntried to do my work and if the brothers don\'t know that, then it\'s too late to\ntell them. I don\'t know what\'s behind this, but I haven\'t gotten around to\ncontrolling magazine writers. And I didn\'t realize that I was coming to stand\ntrial either."\n"This was not intended as a trial," Brother Jack said. "If you\'re ever\nput on trial, and I hope you\'ll never be, you\'ll know it. Meantime, since this\nis an emergency the committee asks that you leave the room while we read\nand discuss the questioned interview."\nI left the room and went into a vacant office, boiling with anger and\ndisgust. Wrestrum had snatched me back to the South in the midst of one of\nthe top Brotherhood committees and I felt naked. I could have throttled him\n-- forcing me to take part in a childish dispute before the others. Yet I had\nto fight him as I could, in terms he understood, even though we sounded like\ncharacters in a razor-slinging vaudeville skit. Perhaps I should mention the\nanonymous note, except that someone might take it to mean that I didn\'t\nhave the full support of my district. If Clifton were here, he\'d know how to\nhandle this clown. Were they taking him seriously just because he was black?\nWhat was wrong with them anyway, couldn\'t they see that they were dealing\nwith a clown? But I would have gone to pieces had they laughed or even\nsmiled, I thought, for they couldn\'t laugh at him without laughing at me as\nwell . . . Yet if they had laughed, it would have been less unreal -- Where\nthe hell am I?\n"You can come in now," a brother called to me; and I went out to\nhear their decision.\n"Well," Brother Jack said, "we\'ve all read the article, Brother, and\nwe\'re happy to report that we found it harmless enough. True, it would have\nbeen better had more wordage been given to other members of the Harlem\ndistrict. But we found no evidence that you had anything to do with that.\nBrother Wrestrum was mistaken."\nHis bland manner and the knowledge that they had wasted time to\nsee the truth released the anger within me.\n"I\'d say that he was criminally mistaken," I said.\n"Not criminal, over-zealous," he said.\n"To me it seems both criminal and over-zealous," I said.\n"No, Brother, not criminal."\n"But he attacked my reputation . . ."\nBrother Jack smiled. "Only because he was sincere, Brother. He was\nthinking of the good of the Brotherhood."\n"But why slander me? I don\'t follow you, Brother Jack. I\'m no\nenemy, as he well knows. I\'m a brother too," I said, seeing his smile.\n"The Brotherhood has many enemies, and we must not be too harsh\nwith brotherly mistakes."\nThen I saw the foolish, abashed expression on Wrestrum\'s face and\nrelaxed.\n"Very well, Brother Jack," I said. "I suppose I should be glad you\nfound me innocent --"\n"Concerning the magazine article," he said, stabbing the air with his\nfinger.\nSomething tensed in the back of my head; I got to my feet.\n"Concerning the article! You mean to say that you believe that other\npipe-dream? Is everyone reading Dick Tracy these days?"\n"This is no matter of Dick Tracy," he snapped. "The movement has\nmany enemies."\n"So now I have become an enemy," I said. "What\'s happened to\neverybody? You act as though none of you has any contact with me at all."\nJack looked at the table. "Are you interested in our decision,\nBrother?"\n"Oh, yes," I said. "Yes, I am. I\'m interested in all manner of odd\nbehavior. Who wouldn\'t be, when one wild man can make a roomful of what\nI\'d come to regard as some of the best minds in the country take him\nseriously. Certainly, I\'m interested. Otherwise I\'d act like a sensible man and\nrun out of here!"\nThere were sounds of protest and Brother Jack, his face red, rapped\nfor order.\n"Perhaps I should address a few words to the brother," Brother\nMacAfee said.\n"Go ahead," Brother Jack said thickly.\n"Brother, we understand how you feel," Brother MacAfee said, "but\nyou must understand that the movement has many enemies. This is very true,\nand we are forced to think of the organization at the expense of our personal\nfeelings. The Brotherhood is bigger than all of us. None of us as individuals\ncount when its safety is questioned. And be assured that none of us have\nanything but goodwill toward you personally. Your work has been splendid.\nThis is simply a matter of the safety of the organization, and it is our\nresponsibility to make a thorough investigation of all such charges."\nI felt suddenly empty; there was a logic in what he said which I felt\ncompelled to accept. They were wrong, but they had the obligation to discover\ntheir mistake. Let them go ahead, they\'d find that none of the charges were\ntrue and I\'d be vindicated. What was all this obsession with enemies anyway?\nI looked into their smoke-washed faces; not since the beginning had I faced\nsuch serious doubts. Up to now I had felt a wholeness about my work and\ndirection such as I\'d never known; not even in my mistaken college days.\nBrotherhood was something to which men could give themselves completely;\nthat was its strength and my strength, and it was this sense of wholeness\nthat guaranteed that it would change the course of history. This I had\nbelieved with all my being, but now, though still inwardly affirming that\nbelief, I felt a blighting hurt which prevented me from trying further to\ndefend myself. I stood there silently, waiting their decision. Someone\ndrummed his fingers against the table top. I heard the dry-leaf rustle of\nonionskin papers.\n"Be assured that you can depend upon the fairness and wisdom of\nthe committee," Brother Tobitt\'s voice drifted from the end of the table, but\nthere was smoke between us and I could barely see his face.\n"The committee has decided," Brother Jack began crisply, "that until\nall charges have been cleared, you are to have the choice of becoming\ninactive in Harlem, or accepting an assignment downtown. In the latter case\nyou are to wind up your present assignment immediately."\nI felt weak in my legs. "You mean I am to give up my work?"\n"Unless you choose to serve the movement elsewhere."\n"But can\'t you see --" I said, looking from face to face and seeing\nthe blank finality in their eyes.\n"Your assignment, should you decide to remain active," Brother Jack\nsaid, reaching for his gavel, "is to lecture downtown on the Woman\nQuestion."\nSuddenly I felt as though I had been spun like a top.\n"The what!"\n"The Woman Question. My pamphlet, \'On the Woman Question in\nthe United States,\' will be your guide. And now, Brothers," he said, his eyes\nsweeping around the table, "the meeting is adjourned."\nI stood there, hearing the rapping of his gavel echoing in my ears,\nthinking the woman question and searching their faces for signs of\namusement, listening to their voices as they filed out into the hall for the\nslightest sound of suppressed laughter, stood there fighting the sense that I\nhad just been made the butt of an outrageous joke and all the more so since\ntheir faces revealed no awareness.\nMy mind fought desperately for acceptance. Nothing would change\nmatters. They would shift me and investigate and I, still believing, still\nbending to discipline, would have to accept their decision. Now was certainly\nno time for inactivity; not just when I was beginning to approach some of\nthe aspects of the organization about which I knew nothing (of higher\ncommittees and the leaders who never appeared, of the sympathizers and\nallies in groups that seemed far removed from our concerns), not at a time\nwhen all the secrets of power and authority still shrouded from me in\nmystery appeared on the way toward revelation. No, despite my anger and\ndisgust, my ambitions were too great to surrender so easily. And why should\nI restrict myself, segregate myself? I was a spokesman -- why shouldn\'t I\nspeak about women, or any other subject? Nothing lay outside the scheme of\nour ideology, there was a policy on everything, and my main concern was to\nwork my way ahead in the movement.\nI left the building still feeling as though I had been violently spun\nbut with optimism growing. Being removed from Harlem was a shock but one\nwhich would hurt them as much as me, for I had learned that the clue to\nwhat Harlem wanted was what I wanted; and my value to the Brotherhood\nwas no different from the value to me of my most useful contact: it\ndepended upon my complete frankness and honesty in stating the\ncommunity\'s hopes and hates, fears and desires. One spoke to the committee\nas well as to the community. No doubt it would work much the same\ndowntown. The new assignment was a challenge and an opportunity for\ntesting how much of what happened in Harlem was due to my own efforts\nand how much to the sheer eagerness of the people themselves. And, after\nall, I told myself, the assignment was also proof of the committee\'s goodwill.\nFor by selecting me to speak with its authority on a subject which elsewhere\nin our society I\'d have found taboo, weren\'t they reaffirming their belief both\nin me and in the principles of Brotherhood, proving that they drew no lines\neven when it came to women? They had to investigate the charges against\nme, but the assignment was their unsentimental affirmation that their belief\nin me was unbroken. I shivered in the hot street. I hadn\'t allowed the idea to\ntake concrete form in my mind, but for a moment I had almost allowed an\nold, southern backwardness which I had thought dead to wreck my career.\nLeaving Harlem was not without its regrets, however, and I couldn\'t\nbring myself to say good-bye to anyone, not even to Brother Tarp or Clifton\n-- not to mention the others upon whom I depended for information\nconcerning the lowest groups in the community. I simply slipped my papers\ninto my brief case and left as though going downtown for a meeting.\nChapter 19\nI went to my first lecture with a sense of excitement. The theme was\na sure-fire guarantee of audience interest and the rest was up to me. If only\nI were a foot taller and a hundred pounds heavier, I could simply stand\nbefore them with a sign across my chest, stating i KNOW ALL ABOUT\nTHEM, and they\'d be as awed as though I were the original boogey man --\nsomehow reformed and domesticated. I\'d no more have to speak than Paul\nRobeson had to act; they\'d simply thrill at the sight of me.\nAnd it went well enough; they made it a success through their own\nenthusiasm, and the barrage of questions afterwards left no doubts in my\nmind. It was only after the meeting was breaking up that there came the\ndevelopments which even my volatile suspicions hadn\'t allowed me to foresee.\nI was exchanging greetings with the audience when she appeared, the kind of\nwoman who glows as though consciously acting a symbolic role of life and\nfeminine fertility. Her problem, she said, had to do with certain aspects of\nour ideology.\n"It\'s rather involved, really," she said with concern, "and while I\nshouldn\'t care to take up your time, I have a feeling that you --"\n"Oh, not at all," I said, guiding her away from the others to stand\nnear a partly uncoiled firehose hanging beside the entrance, "not at all."\n"But, Brother," she said, "it\'s really so late and you must be tired.\nMy problem could wait until some other time . . ."\n"I\'m not that tired," I said. "And if there\'s something bothering you,\nit\'s my duty to do what I can to clear it up."\n"But it\'s quite late," she said. "Perhaps some evening when you\'re not\nbusy you\'ll drop in to see us. Then we could talk at greater length. Unless, of\ncourse. . ."\n"Unless?"\n"Unless," she smiled, "I can induce you to stop by this evening. I\nmight add that I serve a fair cup of coffee."\n"Then I\'m at your service," I said, pushing open the door.\nHer apartment was located in one of the better sections of the city,\nand I must have revealed my surprise upon entering the spacious living room.\n"You can see, Brother" -- the glow she gave the word was disturbing\n-- "it is really the spiritual values of Brotherhood that interest me. Through\nno effort of my own, I have economic security and leisure, but what is that,\nreally, when so much is wrong with the world? I mean when there is no\nspiritual or emotional security, and no justice?"\nShe was slipping out of her coat now, looking earnestly into my face,\nand I thought, Is she a Salvationist, a Puritan-with-reverse-English? --\nremembering Brother Jack\'s private description of wealthy members who, he\nsaid, sought political salvation by contributing financially to the Brotherhood.\nShe was going a little fast for me and I looked at her gravely.\n"I can see that you\'ve thought deeply about this thing," I said.\n"I\'ve tried," she said, "and it\'s most perplexing -- But make yourself\ncomfortable while I put away my things."\nShe was a small, delicately plump woman with raven hair in which a\nthin streak of white had begun almost imperceptibly to show, and when she\nreappeared in the rich red of a hostess gown she was so striking that I had\nto avert my somewhat startled eyes.\n"What a beautiful room you have here," I said, looking across the\nrich cherry glow of furniture to see a life-sized painting of a nude, a pink\nRenoir. Other canvases were hung here and there, and the spacious walls\nseemed to flash alive with warm, pure color. What does one say to all this? I\nthought, looking at an abstract fish of polished brass mounted on a piece of\nebony.\n"I\'m glad you find it pleasant, Brother," she said. "We like it\nourselves, though I must say that Hubert finds so little time to enjoy it. He\'s\nmuch too busy."\n"Hubert?" I said.\n"My husband. Unfortunately he had to leave. He would have loved\nto\'ve met you, but then he\'s always dashing off. Business, you know."\n"I suppose it\'s unavoidable," I said with sudden discomfort.\n"Yes, it is," she said. "But we\'re going to discuss Brotherhood and\nideology, aren\'t we?"\nAnd there was something about her voice and her smile that gave me\na sense of both comfort and excitement. It was not merely the background of\nwealth and gracious living, to which I was alien, but simply the being there\nwith her and the sensed possibility of a heightened communication; as though\nthe discordantly invisible and the conspicuously enigmatic were reaching a\ndelicately balanced harmony. She\'s rich but human, I thought, watching the\nsmooth play of her relaxed hands.\n"There are so many aspects to the movement," I said. "Just where\nshall we start? Perhaps it\'s something that I\'m unable to handle."\n"Oh, it\'s nothing that profound," she said. "I\'m sure you\'ll straighten\nout my little ideological twists and turns. But sit here on the sofa, Brother;\nit\'s more comfortable."\nI sat, seeing her go toward a door, the train of her gown trailing\nsensuously over the oriental carpet. Then she turned and smiled.\n"Perhaps you\'d prefer wine or milk instead of coffee?"\n"Wine, thank you," I said, finding the idea of milk strangely\nrepulsive. This isn\'t at all what I expected, I thought. She returned with a\ntray holding two glasses and a decanter, placing them before us on a low\ncocktail table, and I could hear the wine trickle musically into the glasses,\none of which she placed in front of me.\n"Here\'s to the movement," she said, raising her glass with smiling\neyes.\n"To the movement," I said.\n"And to Brotherhood."\n"And to Brotherhood."\n"This is very nice," I said, seeing her nearly closed eyes, her chin\ntilting upward, toward me, "but just what phase of our ideology should we\ndiscuss?"\n"All of it," she said. "I wish to embrace the whole of it. Life is so\nterribly empty and disorganized without it. I sincerely believe that only\nBrotherhood offers any hope of making life worth living again -- Oh, I know\nthat it\'s too vast a philosophy to grasp immediately, as it were; still, it\'s so\nvital and alive that one gets the feeling that one should at least make the try.\nDon\'t you agree?"\n"Well, yes," I said. "It\'s the most meaningful thing that I know."\n"Oh, I\'m so pleased to have you agree with me. I suppose that\'s why\nI always thrill to hear you speak, somehow you convey the great throbbing\nvitality of the movement. It\'s really amazing. You give me such a feeling of\nsecurity -- although," she interrupted herself with a mysterious smile, "I must\nconfess that you also make me afraid."\n"Afraid? You can\'t mean that," I said.\n"Really," she repeated, as I laughed. "It\'s so powerful, so -- so\nprimitive!"\nI felt some of the air escape from the room, leaving it unnaturally\nquiet. "You don\'t mean primitive?" I said.\n"Yes, primitive; no one has told you, Brother, that at times you have\ntom-toms beating in your voice?"\n"My God," I laughed, "I thought that was the beat of profound\nideas."\n"Of course, you\'re correct," she said. "I don\'t mean really primitive. I\nsuppose I mean forceful, powerful. It takes hold of one\'s emotions as well as\none\'s intellect. Call it what you will, it has so much naked power that it goes\nstraight through one. I tremble just to think of such vitality."\nI looked at her, so close now that I could see a single jet-black\nstrand of out-of-place hair. "Yes," I said, "the emotion is there; but it\'s\nactually our scientific approach that releases it. As Brother Jack says, we\'re\nnothing if not organizers. And the emotion isn\'t merely released, it\'s guided,\nchannelized -- that is the real source of our effectiveness. After all, this very\ngood wine can please emotion, but I doubt seriously that it can organize\nanything."\nShe leaned gracefully forward, her arm along the back of the sofa,\nsaying, "Yes, and you do both in your speeches. One just has to respond,\neven when one isn\'t too clear as to your meaning. Only I do know what\nyou\'re saying and that\'s even more inspiring."\n"Actually, you know, I\'m as much affected by the audience as it is by\nme. Its response helps me do my best."\n"And there\'s another important aspect," she said; "one which concerns\nme greatly. It provides women the full opportunity for self-expression, which\nis so very important, Brother. It\'s as though every day were Leap Year --\nwhich is as it should be. Women should be absolutely as free as men."\nAnd if I were really free, I thought, lifting my glass, I\'d get the hell\nout of here.\n"I thought you were exceptionally good tonight -- it\'s time the woman\nhad a champion in the movement. Until tonight I\'d always heard you on\nminority problems."\n"This is a new assignment," I said. "But from now on one of our\nmain concerns is to be the Woman Question."\n"That\'s wonderful and it\'s about time. Something has to give women\nan opportunity to come to close grips with life. Please go on, tell me your\nideas," she said, pressing forward, her hand light upon my arm.\nAnd I went on talking, relieved to talk, carried away by my own\nenthusiasm and by the warmth of the wine. And it was only when I turned\nto ask a question of her that I realized that she was leaning only a nose-tip\naway, her eyes upon my face.\n"Go on, please go on," I heard. "You make it sound so clear --\nplease."\nI saw the rapid, moth-wing fluttering of her lids become the softness\nof her lips as we were drawn together. There was not an idea or concept in\nit but sheer warmth; then the bell was ringing and I shook it off and got to\nmy feet, hearing it ring again as she arose with me, the red robe falling in\nheavy folds upon the carpet, and she saying, "You make it all so wonderfully\nalive," as the bell sounded again. And I was trying to move, to get out of the\napartment, looking for my hat and filling with anger, thinking, Is she crazy?\nDoesn\'t she hear? as she stood before me in bewilderment, as though I were\nacting irrationally. And now taking my arm with sudden energy, saying, "This\nway, in here," almost pulling me along as the bell rang again, through a door\ndown a short hall, a satiny bedroom, in which she stood appraising me with\na smile, saying, "This is mine," as I looked at her in outrageous disbelief.\n"Yours, yours? But what about that bell?"\n"Never mind," she cooed, looking into my eyes.\n"But be reasonable," I said, pushing her aside. "What about that\ndoor?"\n"Oh, of course, you mean the telephone, don\'t you, darling?"\n"But your old man -- your husband?"\n"In Chicago --"\n"But he might not --"\n"No, no, darling, he won\'t --"\n"But he might!"\n"But, Brother, darling, I talked with him, I know."\n"You what? What kind of game is this?"\n"Oh, you poor darling! It isn\'t a game, really you have no cause to\nworry, we\'re free. He\'s in Chicago, seeking his lost youth, no doubt," she said,\nbursting into laughter of self-surprise. "He\'s not at all interested in uplifting\nthings -- freedom and necessity, woman\'s rights and all that. You know, the\nsickness of our class -- Brother, darling."\nI took a step across the room; there was another door to my left\nthrough which I saw the gleam of chromium and tile.\n"Brotherhood, darling," she said, gripping my biceps with her little\nhands. "Teach me, talk to me. Teach me the beautiful ideology of\nBrotherhood." And I wanted both to smash her and to stay with her and\nknew that I should do neither. Was she trying to ruin me, or was this a trap\nset by some secret enemy of the movement waiting outside the door with\ncameras and wrecking bars?\n"You should answer the phone," I said with forced calm, trying to\nrelease my hands without touching her, for if I touched her --\n"And you\'ll continue?" she said.\nI nodded, seeing her turn without a word and go toward a vanity\nwith a large oval mirror, taking up an ivory telephone. And in the mirrored\ninstant I saw myself standing between her eager form and a huge white bed,\nmyself caught in a guilty stance, my face taut, tie dangling; and behind the\nbed another mirror which now like a surge of the sea tossed our images back\nand forth, back and forth, furiously multiplying the time and the place and\nthe circumstance. My vision seemed to pulse alternately clear and vague,\ndriven by a furious bellows, as her lips said soundlessly, I\'m sorry, and then\nimpatiently into the telephone, "Yes, this is she," and then to me again,\nsmiling as she covered the mouthpiece with her hand, "It\'s only my sister;\nit\'ll only take a second." And my mind whirled with forgotten stories of male\nservants summoned to wash the mistress\'s back; chauffeurs sharing the\nmasters\' wives; Pullman porters invited into the drawing room of rich wives\nheaded for Reno -- thinking, But this is the movement, the Brotherhood. And\nnow I saw her smile, saying, "Yes, Gwen, dear. Yes," as one free hand went\nup as though to smooth her hair and in one swift motion the red robe swept\naside like a veil, and I went breathless, at the petite and generously curved\nnude, framed delicate and firm in the glass. It was like a dream interval and\nin an instant it swung back and I saw only her mysteriously smiling eyes\nabove the rich red robe.\nI was heading for the door, torn between anger and a fierce\nexcitement, hearing the phone click down as I started past and feeling her\nswirl against me and I was lost, for the conflict between the ideological and\nthe biological, duty and desire, had become too subtly confused. I went to\nher, thinking, Let them break down the door, whosoever will, let them come.\nI DIDN\'T know whether I was awake or dreaming. It was dead quiet,\nyet I was certain that there had been a noise and that it had come from\nacross the room as she beside me made a soft sighing sound. It was strange.\nMy mind revolved. I was chased out of a chinkapin woods by a bull. I ran\nup a hill; the whole hill heaved. I heard the sound and looked up to see the\nman looking straight at me from where he stood in the dim light of the hall,\nlooking in with neither interest nor surprise. His face expressionless, his eyes\nstaring. There was the sound of even breathing. Then I heard her stir beside\nme.\n"Oh, hello, dear," she said, her voice sounding far away. "Back so\nsoon?"\n"Yes," he said. "Wake me early, I have a lot to do."\n"I\'ll remember, dear," she said sleepily. "Have a good night\'s rest . .\n."\n"Night, and you too," he said with a short dry laugh.\nThe door closed. I lay there in the dark for a while, breathing\nrapidly. It was strange. I reached out and touched her. There was no answer.\nI leaned over her, feeling her breath breezing warm and pure against my face.\nI wanted to linger there, experiencing the sensation of something precious\nperilously attained too late and now to be lost forever -- a poignancy. But it\nwas as though she\'d never been awake and if she should awaken now, she\'d\nscream, shriek. I slid hurriedly from the bed, keeping my eye on that part of\nthe darkness from where the light had come as I tried to find my clothes. I\nblundered around, finding a chair, an empty chair. Where were my clothes?\nWhat a fool! Why had I gotten myself into such a situation? I felt my way\nnaked through darkness, found the chair with my clothes, dressed hurriedly\nand slipped out, halting only at the door to look back through the dim light\nfrom the hall. She slept without sigh or smile, a beautiful dreamer, one ivory\narm flung above her jet-black head. My heart pounded as I closed the door\nand went down the hall, expecting the man, men, crowds -- to halt me. Then\nI was taking the stairs.\nThe building was quiet. In the lobby the doorman dozed, his starched\nbib buckling beneath his chin with his breathing, his white head bare. I\nreached the street limp with perspiration, still unsure whether I had seen the\nman or had dreamed him. Could I have seen him without his seeing me? Or\nagain, had he seen me and been silent out of sophistication, decadence,\nover-civilization? I hurried down the street, my anxiety growing with each\nstep. Why hadn\'t he said something, recognized me, cursed me? Attacked me?\nOr at least been outraged with her? And what if it were a test to discover\nhow I would react to such pressure? It was, after all, a point upon which our\nenemies would attack us violently. I walked in a sweat of agony. Why did\nthey have to mix their women into everything? Between us and everything we\nwanted to change in the world they placed a woman: socially, politically,\neconomically. Why, goddamit, why did they insist upon confusing the class\nstruggle with the ass struggle, debasing both us and them -- all human\nmotives?\nAll the next day I was in a state of exhaustion, waiting tensely for\nthe plan to be revealed. Now I was certain that the man had been in the\ndoorway, a man with a brief case who had looked in and given no definite\nsign that he had seen me. A man who had spoken like an indifferent\nhusband, but who yet seemed to recall to me some important member of the\nBrotherhood -- someone so familiar that my failure to identify him was\ndriving me almost to distraction. My work lay untouched before me. Each\nring of the telephone filled me with dread. I toyed with Tarp\'s leg chain.\nIf they don\'t call by four o\'clock, I\'m saved, I told myself. But still\nno sign, not even a call to a meeting. Finally I rang her number, hearing her\nvoice, delighted, gay and discreet; but no mention of the night or the man.\nAnd hearing her so composed and gay I was too embarrassed to bring it up.\nPerhaps this was the sophisticated and civilized way? Perhaps he was there\nand they had an understanding, a woman with full rights.\nWould I return for further discussion, she wanted to know.\n"Yes, of course," I said.\n"Oh, Brother," she said.\nI hung up with a mixture of relief and anxiety, unable to shrug off\nthe notion that I had been tested and had failed. I went through the next\nweek puzzling over it, and even more confused because I knew nothing\ndefinite of where I stood. I tried to detect any changes in my relations with\nBrother Jack and the others, but they gave no sign. And even if they had, I\nwouldn\'t have known its definite meaning, for it might have had to do with\nthe charges. I was caught between guilt and innocence, so that now they\nseemed one and the same. My nerves were in a state of constant tension, my\nface took on a stiff, non-committal expression, beginning to look like Brother\nJack\'s and the other leaders\'. Then I relaxed a bit; work had to be done and\nI would play the waiting game. And despite my guilt and uncertainty I\nlearned to forget that I was a lone guilty black Brother and to go striding\nconfidently into a roomful of whites. It was chin up, a not too wide-stretched\nsmile, the out-thrust hand for the firm warm hand shake. And with it just\nthe proper mixture of arrogance and down-to-earth humility to satisfy all. I\nthrew myself into the lectures, defending, asserting the rights of women; and\nthough the girls continued to buzz around, I was careful to keep the\nbiological and ideological carefully apart -- which wasn\'t always easy, for it\nwas as though many of the sisters were agreed among themselves (and\nassumed that I accepted it) that the ideological was merely a superfluous veil\nfor the real concerns of life.\nI found that most downtown audiences seemed to expect some\nunnamed something whenever I appeared. I could sense it the moment I\nstood before them, and it had nothing to do with anything I might say. For I\nhad merely to appear before them, and from the moment they turned their\neyes upon me they seemed to undergo a strange unburdening -- not of\nlaughter, nor of tears, nor of any stable, unmixed emotion. I didn\'t get it.\nAnd my guilt was aroused. Once in the middle of a passage I looked into the\nsea of faces and thought, Do they know? Is that it? -- and almost ruined my\nlecture. But of one thing I was certain, it was not the same attitude they held\nfor certain other black brothers who entertained them with stories so often\nthat they laughed even before these fellows opened their mouths. No, it was\nsomething else. A form of expectancy, a mood of waiting, a hoping for\nsomething like justification; as though they expected me to be more than just\nanother speaker, or an entertainer. Something seemed to occur that was\nhidden from my own consciousness. I acted out a pantomime more eloquent\nthan my most expressive words. I was a partner to it but could no more\nfathom it than I could the mystery of the man in the doorway. Perhaps, I\ntold myself, it\'s in your voice, after all. In your voice and in their desire to\nsee in you a living proof of their belief in Brotherhood, and to ease my mind\nI stopped thinking about it.\nThen one night when I had fallen asleep while making notes for a\nnew series of lectures, the phone summoned me to an emergency meeting at\nheadquarters, and I left the house with feelings of dread. This is it, I thought,\neither the charges or the woman. To be tripped up by a woman! What would\nI say to them, that she was irresistible and I human? What had that to do\nwith responsibility, with building Brotherhood?\nIt was all I could do to make myself go, and I arrived late. The\nroom was sweltering; three small fans stirred the heavy air, and the brothers\nsat in their shirtsleeves around a scarred table upon which a pitcher of iced\nwater glistened with beads of moisture.\n"Brothers, I\'m sorry I\'m late," I apologized. "There were some\nimportant last-minute details concerning tomorrow\'s lecture that kept me."\n"Then you might have saved yourself the trouble and the committee\nthis lost time," Brother Jack said.\n"I don\'t understand you," I said, suddenly feverish.\n"He means that you are no longer to concern yourself with the\nWoman Question. That\'s ended," Brother Tobitt said; and I braced myself for\nthe attack, but before I could respond Brother Jack fired a startling question\nat me.\n"What has become of Brother Tod Clifton?"\n"Brother Clifton -- why, I haven\'t seen him in weeks. I\'ve been too\nbusy downtown here. What\'s happened?"\n"He has disappeared," Brother Jack said, "disappeared! So don\'t waste\ntime with superfluous questions. You weren\'t sent for for that."\n"But how long has this been known?"\nBrother Jack struck the table. "All we know is that he\'s gone. Let\'s\nget on with our business. You, Brother, are to return to Harlem immediately.\nWe\'re facing a crisis there, since Brother Tod Clifton has not only disappeared\nbut failed in his assignment. On the other hand, Ras the Exhorter and his\ngang of racist gangsters are taking advantage of this and are increasing their\nagitation. You are to get back there and take measures to regain our strength\nin the community. You\'ll be given the forces you need and you\'ll report to us\nfor a strategy meeting about which you\'ll be notified tomorrow. And please,"\nhe emphasized with his gavel, "be on time!"\nI was so relieved that none of my own problems were discussed that\nI didn\'t linger to ask if the police had been consulted about the\ndisappearance. Something was wrong with the whole deal, for Clifton was too\nresponsible and had too much to gain simply to have disappeared. Did it\nhave any connection with Ras the Exhorter? But that seemed unlikely; Harlem\nwas one of our strongest districts, and just a month ago when I was shifted\nRas would have been laughed off the street had he tried to attack us. If only\nI hadn\'t been so careful not to offend the committee I would have kept in\ncloser contact with Clifton and the whole Harlem membership. Now it was as\nthough I had been suddenly awakened from a deep sleep.\nChapter 20\nI had been away long enough for the streets to seem strange. The\nuptown rhythms were slower and yet were somehow faster; a different tension\nwas in the hot night air. I made my way through the summer crowds, not to\nthe district but to Barrelhouse\'s Jolly Dollar, a dark hole of a bar and grill\non upper Eighth Avenue, where one of my best contacts, Brother Maceo,\ncould usually be found about this time, having his evening\'s beer.\nLooking through the window, I could see men in working clothes and\na few rummy women leaning at the bar, and down the aisle between the bar\nand counter were a couple of men in black and blue checked sport shirts\neating barbecue. A cluster of men and women hovered near the juke box at\nthe rear. But when I went in Brother Maceo wasn\'t among them and I\npushed to the bar, deciding to wait over a beer.\n"Good evening, Brothers," I said, finding myself beside two men\nwhom I had seen around before; only to have them look at me oddly, the\neyebrows of the tall one raising at a drunken angle as he looked at the other.\n"Shit," the tall man said.\n"You said it, man; he a relative of yourn?"\n"Shit, he goddam sho ain\'t no kin of mine!"\nI turned and looked at them, the room suddenly cloudy.\n"He must be drunk," the second man said. "Maybe he thinks he\'s kin\nto you."\n"Then his whiskey\'s telling him a damn lie. I wouldn\'t be his kin\neven if I was -- Hey, Barrelhouse!"\nI moved away, down the bar, looking at them out of a feeling of\nsuspense. They didn\'t sound drunk and I had said nothing to offend, and I\nwas certain that they knew who I was. What was it? The Brotherhood\ngreeting was as familiar as "Give me some skin" or "Peace, it\'s wonderful."\nI saw Barrelhouse rolling down from the other end of the bar, his\nwhite apron indented by the tension of its cord so that he looked like that\nkind of metal beer barrel which has a groove around its middle; and seeing\nme now, he began to smile.\n"Well, I\'ll be damned if it ain\'t the good brother," he said, stretching\nout his hand. "Brother, where you been keeping yourself?"\n"I\'ve been working downtown," I said, feeling a surge of gratitude.\n"Fine, fine!" Barrelhouse said.\n"Business good?"\n"I\'d rather not discuss it, Brother. Business is bad. Very bad."\n"I\'m sorry to hear it. You\'d better give me a beer," I said, "after\nyou\'ve served these gentlemen." I watched them in the mirror.\n"Sure thing," Barrelhouse said, reaching for a glass and drawing a\nbeer. "What you putting down, ole man?" he said to the tall man.\n"Look here, Barrel, we wanted to ask you one question," the tall one\nsaid. "We just wanted to know if you could tell us just whose brother this\nhere cat\'s supposed to be? He come in here just now calling everybody\nbrother."\n"He\'s my brother," Barrel said, holding the foaming glass between his\nlong fingers. "Anything wrong with that?"\n"Look, fellow," I said down the bar, "that\'s our way of speaking. I\nmeant no harm in calling you brother. I\'m sorry you misunderstood me."\n"Brother, here\'s your beer," Barrelhouse said.\n"So he\'s your brother, eh, Barrel?"\nBarrel\'s eyes narrowed as he pressed his huge chest across the bar,\nlooking suddenly sad. "You enjoying yourself, MacAdams?" he said gloomily.\n"You like your beer?"\n"Sho," MacAdams said.\n"It cold enough?"\n"Sho, but Barrel --"\n"You like the groovy music on the juke?" Barrelhouse said.\n"Hell, yes, but --"\n"And you like our good, clean, sociable atmosphere?"\n"Sho, but that ain\'t what I\'m talking about," the man said.\n"Yeah, but that\'s what I\'m talking about," Barrelhouse said\nmournfully. "And if you like it, like it, and don\'t start trying to bug my other\ncustomers. This here man\'s done more for the community than you\'ll ever\ndo."\n"What community?" MacAdams said, cutting his eyes around toward\nme. "I hear he got the white fever and left . . ."\n"You liable to hear anything," Barrelhouse said. "There\'s some paper\nback there in the gents\' room. You ought to wipe out your ears."\n"Never mind my ears."\n"Aw come" on, Mac," his friend said. "Forgit it. Ain\'t the man done\napologized?"\n"I said never mind my ears," MacAdams said. "You just tell your\nbrother he ought to be careful \'bout who he claims as kinfolks. Some of us\ndon\'t think so much of his kind of politics."\nI looked from one to the other. I considered myself beyond the stage\nof street-fighting, and one of the worst things I could do upon returning to\nthe community was to engage in a brawl. I looked at MacAdams and was\nglad when the other man pushed him down the bar.\n"That MacAdams thinks he\'s right," Barrelhouse said. "He\'s the kind\ncaint nobody please. Be frank though, there\'s lots feel like that now."\nI shook my head in bafflement. I\'d never met that kind of\nantagonism before. "What\'s happened to Brother Maceo?" I said.\n"I don\'t know, Brother. He don\'t come in so regular these days.\nThings are kinda changing up here. Ain\'t much money floating around."\n"Times are hard everywhere. But what\'s been going on up here,\nBarrel?" I said.\n"Oh, you know how it is, Brother; things are tight and lots of folks\nwho got jobs through you people have lost them. You know how it goes."\n"You mean people in our organization?"\n"Quite a few of them are. Fellows like Brother Maceo."\n"But why? They were doing all right."\n"Sure they was -- as long as you people was fighting for \'em. But the\nminute y\'all stopped, they started throwing folks out on the street."\nI looked at him, big and sincere before me. It was unbelievable that\nthe Brotherhood had stopped its work, and yet he wasn\'t lying. "Give me\nanother beer," I said. Then someone called him from the back, and he drew\nthe beer and left.\nI drank it slowly, hoping Brother Maceo would appear before I had\nfinished. When he didn\'t I waved to Barrelhouse and left for the district.\nPerhaps Brother Tarp could explain; or at least tell me something about\nClifton.\nI walked through the dark block over to Seventh and started down;\nthings were beginning to look serious. Along the way I saw not a single sign\nof Brotherhood activity. In a hot side street I came upon a couple striking\nmatches along the curb, kneeling as though looking for a lost coin, the\nmatches flaring dimly in their faces. Then I found myself in a strangely\nfamiliar block and broke out in a sweat: I had walked almost to Mary\'s door,\nand turned now and hurried away.\nBarrelhouse had prepared me for the darkened windows of the\ndistrict, but not, when I let myself in, to call in vain through the dark to\nBrother Tarp. I went to the room where he slept, but he was not there; then\nI went through the dark hall to my old office and threw myself into my desk\nchair, exhausted. Everything seemed to be slipping away from me and I could\nfind no quick absorbing action that would get it under control. I tried to\nthink of whom among the district committee I might call for information\nconcerning Clifton, but here again I was balked. For if I selected one who\nbelieved that I had requested to be transferred because I hated my own\npeople it would only complicate matters. No doubt there would be some\nwho\'d resent my return, so it was best to confront them all at once without\ngiving any one of them the opportunity to organize any sentiment against me.\nIt was best that I talk with Brother Tarp, whom I trusted. When he came in\nhe could give me an idea of the state of affairs, and perhaps tell me what\nhad actually happened to Clifton.\nBut Brother Tarp didn\'t arrive. I went out and got a container of\ncoffee and returned to spend the night poring over the district\'s records.\nWhen he hadn\'t returned by three A.M. I went to his room and took a look\naround. It was empty, even the bed was gone. I\'m all alone, I thought. A lot\nhas occurred about which I wasn\'t told; something that had not only stifled\nthe members\' interest but which, according to the records, had sent them\naway in droves. Barrelhouse had said that the organization had quit fighting,\nand that was the only explanation I could find for Brother Tarp\'s leaving.\nUnless, of course, he\'d had disagreements with Clifton or some of the other\nleaders. And now returning to my desk I noticed his gift of Douglass\' portrait\nwas gone. I felt in my pocket for the leg chain, at least I hadn\'t forgotten to\ntake that along. I pushed the records aside; they told me nothing of why\nthings were as they were. Picking up the telephone I called Clifton\'s number,\nhearing it ring on and on. Finally I gave it up and went to sleep in my\nchair. Everything had to wait until the strategy meeting. Returning to the\ndistrict was like returning to a city of the dead.\nSomewhat to my surprise there were a good number of members in\nthe hall when I awoke, and having no directives from the committee on how\nto proceed I organized them into teams to search for Brother Clifton. Not one\ncould give me any definite information. Brother Clifton had appeared at the\ndistrict as usual up to the time of his disappearance. There had been no\nquarrels with committee members, and he was as popular as ever. Nor had\nthere been any clashes with Ras the Exhorter -- although in the past week he\nhad been increasingly active. As for the loss of membership and influence, it\nwas a result of a new program which had called for the shelving of our old\ntechniques of agitation. There had been, to my surprise, a switch in emphasis\nfrom local issues to those more national and international in scope, and it\nwas felt that for the moment the interests of Harlem were not of first\nimportance. I didn\'t know what to make of it, since there had been no such\nchange of program downtown. Clifton was forgotten, everything which I was\nto do now seemed to depend upon getting an explanation from the\ncommittee, and I waited with growing agitation to be called to the strategy\nmeeting.\nSuch meetings were usually held around one o\'clock and we were\nnotified well ahead. But by eleven-thirty I had received no word and I\nbecame worried. By twelve an uneasy sense of isolation took hold of me.\nSomething was cooking, but what, how, why? Finally I phoned headquarters,\nbut could reach none of the leaders. What is this, I wondered; then I called\nthe leaders of other districts with the same results. And now I was certain\nthat the meeting was being held. But why without me? Had they investigated\nWrestrum\'s charges and decided they were true? It seemed that the\nmembership had fallen off after I had gone downtown. Or was it the woman?\nWhatever it was, now was not the time to leave me out of a meeting; things\nwere too urgent in the district. I hurried down to headquarters.\nWhen I arrived the meeting was in session, just as I expected, and\nword had been left that it was not to be disturbed by anyone. It was obvious\nthat they hadn\'t forgotten to notify me. I left the building in a rage. Very\nwell, I thought, when they do decide to call me they\'ll have to find me. I\nshould never have been shifted in the first place, and now that I was sent\nback to clean up the mess they should aid me as quickly as possible. I would\ndo no more running downtown, nor would I accept any program that they\nsent up without consulting the Harlem committee. Then I decided, of all\nthings, to shop for a pair of new shoes, and walked over to Fifth Avenue.\nIt was hot, the walks still filled with noontime crowds moving with\nreluctance back to their jobs. I moved along close to the curb to avoid the\nbumping and agitated changes of pace, the chattering women in summer\ndresses, finally entering the leather-smelling, air-cooled interior of the shoe\nstore with a sense of relief.\nMy feet felt light in the new summer shoes as I went back into the\nblazing heat, and I recalled the old boyhood pleasure of discarding winter\nshoes for sneakers and the neighborhood foot races that always followed, that\nlight-footed, speedy, floating sensation. Well, I thought, you\'ve run your last\nfoot race and you\'d better get back to the district in case you\'re called. I\nhurried now, my feet feeling trim and light as I moved through the oncoming\nrush of sunbeaten faces. To avoid the crowd on Forty-second Street I turned\noff at Forty-third and it was here that things began to boil.\nA small fruit wagon with an array of bright peaches and pears stood\nnear the curb, and the vendor, a florid man with bulbous nose and bright\nblack Italian eyes, looked at me knowingly from beneath his huge\nwhite-and-orange umbrella then over toward a crowd that had formed\nalongside the building across the street. What\'s wrong with him? I thought.\nThen I was across the street and passing the group standing with their backs\nto me. A clipped, insinuating voice spieled words whose meaning I couldn\'t\ncatch and I was about to pass on when I saw the boy. He was a slender\nbrown fellow whom I recognized immediately as a close friend of Clifton\'s,\nand who now was looking intently across the tops of cars to where down the\nblock near the post office on the other side a tall policeman was approaching.\nPerhaps he\'ll know something, I thought, as he looked around to see me and\nstopped in confusion.\n"Hello, there," I began, and when he turned toward the crowd and\nwhistled I didn\'t know whether he was telling me to do the same or\nsignalling to someone else. I swung around, seeing him step to where a large\ncarton sat beside the building and sling its canvas straps to his shoulder as\nonce more he looked toward the policeman, ignoring me. Puzzled, I moved\ninto the crowd and pressed to the front where at my feet I saw a square\npiece of cardboard upon which something was moving with furious action. It\nwas some kind of toy and I glanced at the crowd\'s fascinated eyes and down\nagain, seeing it clearly this time. I\'d seen nothing like it before. A grinning\ndoll of orange-and-black tissue paper with thin flat cardboard disks forming\nits head and feet and which some mysterious mechanism was causing to\nmove up and down in a loose-jointed, shoulder-shaking, infuriatingly sensuous\nmotion, a dance that was completely detached from the black, mask-like face.\nIt\'s no jumping-jack, but what, I thought, seeing the doll throwing itself about\nwith the fierce defiance of someone performing a degrading act in public,\ndancing as though it received a perverse pleasure from its motions. And\nbeneath the chuckles of the crowd I could hear the swishing of its ruffled\npaper, while the same out-of-the-corner-of-the-mouth voice continued to spiel:\nShake it up! Shake it up!\nHe\'s Sambo, the dancing doll, ladies and gentlemen.\nShake him, stretch him by the neck and set him down,\n-- He\'ll do the rest. Yes!\nHe\'ll make you laugh, he\'ll make you sigh, si-igh.\nHe\'ll make you want to dance, and dance --\nHere you are, ladies and gentlemen, Sambo,\nThe dancing doll.\nBuy one for your baby. Take him to your girl friend and she\'ll love\nyou, loove you!\nHe\'ll keep you entertained. He\'ll make you weep sweet --\nTears from laughing.\nShake him, shake him, you cannot break him\nFor he\'s Sambo, the dancing, Sambo, the prancing,\nSambo, the entrancing, Sambo Boogie Woogie paper doll.\nAnd all for twenty-five cents, the quarter part of a dollar . . .\nLadies and gentlemen, he\'ll bring you joy, step up and meet him,\nSambo the --\nI knew I should get back to the district but I was held by the\ninanimate, boneless bouncing of the grinning doll and struggled between the\ndesire to join in the laughter and to leap upon it with both feet, when it\nsuddenly collapsed and I saw the tip of the spieler\'s toe press upon the\ncircular cardboard that formed the feet and a broad black hand come down,\nits fingers deftly lifting the doll\'s head and stretching it upward, twice its\nlength, then releasing it to dance again. And suddenly the voice didn\'t go\nwith the hand. It was as though I had waded out into a shallow pool only to\nhave the bottom drop out and the water close over my head. I looked up.\n"Not you . . ." I began. But his eyes looked past me deliberately\nunseeing. I was paralyzed, looking at him, knowing I wasn\'t dreaming,\nhearing:\nWhat makes him happy, what makes him dance,\nThis Sambo, this jambo, this high-stepping joy boy?\nHe\'s more than a toy, ladies and gentlemen, he\'s Sambo, the dancing\ndoll, the twentieth-century miracle.\nLook at that rumba, that suzy-q, he\'s Sambo-Boogie,\nSambo-Woogie, you don\'t have to feed him, he sleeps collapsed, he\'ll\nkill your depression\nAnd your dispossession, he lives upon the sunshine of your lordly\nsmile\nAnd only twenty-five cents, the brotherly two bits of a dollar because\nhe wants me to eat.\nIt gives him pleasure to see me eat.\nYou simply take him and shake him . . . and he does the rest.\nThank you, lady . . .\nIt was Clifton, riding easily back and forth on his knees, flexing his\nlegs without shifting his feet, his right shoulder raised at an angle and his\narm pointing stiffly at the bouncing doll as he spieled from the corner of his\nmouth.\nThe whistle came again, and I saw him glance quickly toward his\nlookout, the boy with the carton.\n"Who else wants little Sambo before we take it on the lambo? Speak\nup, ladies and gentlemen, who wants little . . . ?"\nAnd again the whistle. "Who wants Sambo, the dancing, prancing?\nHurry, hurry, ladies and gentlemen. There\'s no license for little Sambo, the\njoy spreader. You can\'t tax joy, so speak up, ladies and gentlemen . . ."\nFor a second our eyes met and he gave me a contemptuous smile,\nthen he spieled again. I felt betrayed. I looked at the doll and felt my throat\nconstrict. The rage welled behind the phlegm as I rocked back on my heels\nand crouched forward. There was a flash of whiteness and a splatter like\nheavy rain striking a newspaper and I saw the doll go over backwards, wilting\ninto a dripping rag of frilled tissue, the hateful head upturned on its\noutstretched neck still grinning toward the sky. The crowd turned on me\nindignantly. The whistle came again. I saw a short pot-bellied man look\ndown, then up at me with amazement and explode with laughter, pointing\nfrom me to the doll, rocking. People backed away from me. I saw Clifton step\nclose to the building where beside the fellow with the carton I now saw a\nwhole chorus-line of dolls flouncing themselves with a perverse increase of\nenergy and the crowd laughing hysterically.\n"You, you!" I began, only to see him pick up two of the dolls and\nstep forward. But now the lookout came close. "He\'s coming," he said,\nnodding toward the approaching policeman as he swept up the dolls, dropping\nthem into the carton and starting away.\n"Follow little Sambo around the corner, ladies and gentlemen," Clifton\ncalled. "There\'s a great show coming up . . ."\nIt happened so fast that in a second only I and an old lady in a\nblue polka-dot dress were left. She looked at me then back to the walk,\nsmiling. I saw one of the dolls. I looked. She was still smiling and I raised\nmy foot to crush it, hearing her cry, "Oh, no!" The policeman was just\nopposite and I reached down instead, picking it up and walking off in the\nsame motion. I examined it, strangely weightless in my hand, half expecting\nto feel it pulse with life. It was a still frill of paper. I dropped it in the\npocket where I carried Brother Tarp\'s chain link and started after the\nvanished crowd. But I couldn\'t face Clifton again. I didn\'t want to see him. I\nmight forget myself and attack him. I went in the other direction, toward\nSixth Avenue, past the policeman. What a way to find him, I thought. What\nhad happened to Clifton? It was all so wrong, so unexpected. How on earth\ncould he drop from Brotherhood to this in so short a time? And why if he\nhad to fall back did he try to carry the whole structure with him? What\nwould non-members who knew him say? It was as though he had chosen --\nhow had he put it the night he fought with Ras? -- to fall outside of history.\nI stopped in the middle of the walk with the thought. "To plunge," he had\nsaid. But he knew that only in the Brotherhood could we make ourselves\nknown, could we avoid being empty Sambo dolls. Such an obscene flouncing\nof everything human! My God! And I had been worrying about being left out\nof a meeting! I\'d overlook it a thousand times; no matter why I wasn\'t called.\nI\'d forget it and hold on desperately to Brotherhood with all my strength. For\nto break away would be to plunge . . . To plunge! And those dolls, where\nhad they found them? Why had he picked that way to earn a quarter? Why\nnot sell apples or song sheets, or shine shoes?\nI wandered past the subway and continued around the corner to\nForty-second Street, my mind grappling for meaning. And when I came\naround the corner onto the crowded walk into the sun, they were already\nlining the curb and shading their faces with their hands. I saw the traffic\nmoving with the lights, and across the street a few pedestrians were looking\nback toward the center of the block where the trees of Bryant Park rose\nabove two men. I saw a flight of pigeons whirl out of the trees and it all\nhappened in the swift interval of their circling, very abruptly and in the noise\nof the traffic -- yet seeming to unfold in my mind like a slow-motion movie\nrun off with the sound track dead.\nAt first I thought it was a cop and a shoeshine boy; then there was\na break in the traffic and across the sun-glaring bands of trolley rails I\nrecognized Clifton. His partner had disappeared now and Clifton had the box\nslung to his left shoulder with the cop moving slowly behind and to one side\nof him. They were coming my way, passing a newsstand, and I saw the rails\nin the asphalt and a fire plug at the curb and the flying birds, and thought,\nYou\'ll have to follow and pay his fine . . . just as the cop pushed him, jolting\nhim forward and Clifton trying to keep the box from swinging against his leg\nand saying something over his shoulder and going forward as one of the\npigeons swung down into the street and up again, leaving a feather floating\nwhite in the dazzling backlight of the sun, and I could see the cop push\nClifton again, stepping solidly forward in his black shirt, his arm shooting out\nstiffly, sending him in a head-snapping forward stumble until he caught\nhimself, saying something over his shoulder again, the two moving in a kind\nof march that I\'d seen many times, but never with anyone like Clifton. And I\ncould see the cop bark a command and lunge forward, thrusting out his arm\nand missing, thrown off balance as suddenly Clifton spun on his toes like a\ndancer and swung his right arm over and around in a short, jolting arc, his\ntorso carrying forward and to the left in a motion that sent the box strap\nfree as his right foot traveled forward and his left arm followed through in a\nfloating uppercut that sent the cop\'s cap sailing into the street and his feet\nflying, to drop him hard, rocking from left to right on the walk as Clifton\nkicked the box thudding aside and crouched, his left foot forward, his hands\nhigh, waiting. And between the flashing of cars I could see the cop propping\nhimself on his elbows like a drunk trying to get his head up, shaking it and\nthrusting it forward -- And somewhere between the dull roar of traffic and\nthe subway vibrating underground I heard rapid explosions and saw each\npigeon diving wildly as though blackjacked by the sound, and the cop sitting\nup straight now, and rising to his knees looking steadily at Clifton, and the\npigeons plummeting swiftly into the trees, and Clifton still facing the cop and\nsuddenly crumpling.\nHe fell forward on his knees, like a man saying his prayers just as a\nheavy-set man in a hat with a turned-down brim stepped from around the\nnewsstand and yelled a protest. I couldn\'t move. The sun seemed to scream\nan inch above my head. Someone shouted. A few men were starting into the\nstreet. The cop was standing now and looking down at Clifton as though\nsurprised, the gun in his hand. I took a few steps forward, walking blindly\nnow, unthinking, yet my mind registering it all vividly. Across and starting up\non the curb, and seeing Clifton up closer now, lying in the same position, on\nhis side, a huge wetness growing on his shirt, and I couldn\'t set my foot\ndown. Cars sailed close behind me, but 1 couldn\'t take the step that would\nraise me up to the walk. I stood there, one leg in the street and the other\nraised above the curb, hearing whistles screeching and looked toward the\nlibrary to see two cops coming on in a lunging, big-bellied run. I looked back\nto Clifton, the cop was waving me away with his gun, sounding like a boy\nwith a changing voice.\n"Get back on the other side," he said. He was the cop that I\'d\npassed on Forty-third a few minutes before. My mouth was dry.\n"He\'s a friend of mine, I want to help . . ." I said, finally stepping\nupon the curb.\n"He don\'t need no help, Junior. Get across that street!"\nThe cop\'s hair hung on the sides of his face, his uniform was dirty,\nand I watched him without emotion, hesitated, hearing the sound of footfalls\napproaching. Everything seemed slowed down. A pool formed slowly on the\nwalk. My eyes blurred. I raised my head. The cop looked at me curiously.\nAbove in the park I could hear the furious flapping of wings; on my neck,\nthe pressure of eyes. I turned. A round-headed, apple-cheeked boy with a\nthickly freckled nose and Slavic eyes leaned over the fence of the park above,\nand now as he saw me turn, he shrilled something to someone behind him,\nhis face lighting up with ecstasy . . . What does it mean, I wondered, turning\nback to that to which I did not wish to turn.\nThere were three cops now, one watching the crowd and the others\nlooking at Clifton. The first cop had his cap on again.\n"Look, Junior," he said very clearly, "I had enough trouble for today\n-- you going to get on across that street?"\nI opened my mouth but nothing would come. Kneeling, one of the\ncops was examining Clifton and making notes on a pad.\n"I\'m his friend," I said, and the one making notes looked up.\n"He\'s a cooked pigeon, Mac," he said. "You ain\'t got any friend any\nmore."\nI looked at him.\n"Hey, Mickey," the boy above us called, "the guy\'s out cold!"\nI looked down. "That\'s right," the kneeling cop said. "What\'s your\nname?"\nI told him. I answered his questions about Clifton as best I could\nuntil the wagon came. For once it came quickly. I watched numbly as they\nmoved him inside, placing the box of dolls in with him. Across the street the\ncrowd still churned. Then the wagon was gone and I started back toward the\nsubway.\n"Say, mister," the boy\'s voice shrilled down. "Your friend sure knows\nhow to use his dukes. Biff, bang! One, two, and the cop\'s on his ass!"\nI bowed my head to this final tribute, and now walking away in the\nsun I tried to erase the scene from my mind.\nI WANDERED down the subway stairs seeing nothing, my mind\nplunging. The subway was cool and I leaned against a pillar, hearing the roar\nof trains passing across on the other side, feeling the rushing roar of air.\nWhy should a man deliberately plunge outside of history and peddle an\nobscenity, my mind went on abstractedly. Why should he choose to disarm\nhimself, give up his voice and leave the only organization offering him a\nchance to "define" himself? The platform vibrated and I looked down. Bits of\npaper whirled up in the passage of air, settling quickly as a train moved past.\nWhy had he turned away? Why had he chosen to step off the platform and\nfall beneath the train? Why did he choose to plunge into nothingness, into\nthe void of faceless faces, of soundless voices, lying outside history? I tried to\nstep away and look at it from a distance of words read in books,\nhalf-remembered. For history records the patterns of men\'s lives, they say:\nWho slept with whom and with what results; who fought and who won and\nwho lived to lie about it afterwards. All things, it is said, are duly recorded --\nall things of importance, that is. But not quite, for actually it is only the\nknown, the seen, the heard and only those events that the recorder regards as\nimportant that are put down, those lies his keepers keep their power by. But\nthe cop would be Clifton\'s historian, his judge, his witness, and his\nexecutioner, and I was the only brother in the watching crowd. And I, the\nonly witness for the defense, knew neither the extent of his guilt nor the\nnature of his crime. Where were the historians today? And how would they\nput it down?\nI stood there with the trains plunging in and out, throwing blue\nsparks. What did they ever think of us transitory ones? Ones such as I had\nbeen before I found Brotherhood -- birds of passage who were too obscure\nfor learned classification, too silent for the most sensitive recorders of sound;\nof natures too ambiguous for the most ambiguous words, and too distant\nfrom the centers of historical decision to sign or even to applaud the signers\nof historical documents? We who write no novels, histories or other books.\nWhat about us, I thought, seeing Clifton again in my mind and going to sit\nupon a bench as a cool gust of air rolled up the tunnel.\nA body of people came down the platform, some of them Negroes.\nYes, I thought, what about those of us who shoot up from the South into the\nbusy city like wild jacks-in-the-box broken loose from our springs -- so\nsudden that our gait becomes like that of deep-sea divers suffering from the\nbends? What about those fellows waiting still and silent there on the\nplatform, so still and silent that they clash with the crowd in their very\nimmobility; standing noisy in their very silence; harsh as a cry of terror in\ntheir quietness? What about those three boys, coming now along the platform,\ntall and slender, walking stiffly with swinging shoulders in their well-pressed,\ntoo-hot-for-summer suits, their collars high and tight about their necks, their\nidentical hats of black cheap felt set upon the crowns of their heads with a\nsevere formality above their hard conked hair? It was as though I\'d never\nseen their like before: Walking slowly, their shoulders swaying, their legs\nswinging from their hips in trousers that ballooned upward from cuffs fitting\nsnug about their ankles; their coats long and hip-tight with shoulders far too\nbroad to be those of natural western men. These fellows whose bodies seemed\n-- what had one of my teachers said of me? -- "You\'re like one of these\nAfrican sculptures, distorted in the interest of a design." Well, what design\nand whose?\nI stared as they seemed to move like dancers in some kind of funeral\nceremony, swaying, going forward, their black faces secret, moving slowly\ndown the subway platform, the heavy heel-plated shoes making a rhythmical\ntapping as they moved. Everyone must have seen them, or heard their muted\nlaughter, or smelled the heavy pomade on their hair -- or perhaps failed to\nsee them at all. For they were men outside of historical time, they were\nuntouched, they didn\'t believe in Brotherhood, no doubt had never heard of\nit; or perhaps like Clifton would mysteriously have rejected its mysteries; men\nof transition whose faces were immobile.\nI got up and went behind them. Women shoppers with bundles and\nimpatient men in straw hats and seersucker suits stood along the platform as\nthey passed. And suddenly I found myself thinking, Do they come to bury the\nothers or to be entombed, to give life or to receive it? Do the others see\nthem, think about them, even those standing close enough to speak? And if\nthey spoke back, would the impatient businessmen in conventional suits and\ntired housewives with their plunder, understand? What would they say? For\nthe boys speak a jived-up transitional language full of country glamour, think\ntransitional thoughts, though perhaps they dream the same old ancient\ndreams. They were men out of time -- unless they found Brotherhood. Men\nout of time, who would soon be gone and forgotten . . . But who knew (and\nnow I began to tremble so violently I had to lean against a refuse can) --\nwho knew but that they were the saviors, the true leaders, the bearers of\nsomething precious? The stewards of something uncomfortable, burdensome,\nwhich they hated because, living outside the realm of history, there was no\none to applaud their value and they themselves failed to understand it. What\nif Brother Jack were wrong? What if history was a gambler, instead of a force\nin a laboratory experiment, and the boys his ace in the hole? What if history\nwas not a reasonable citizen, but a madman full of paranoid guile and these\nboys his agents, his big surprise! His own revenge? For they were outside, in\nthe dark with Sambo, the dancing paper doll; taking it on the lambo with my\nfallen brother, Tod Clifton (Tod, Tod) running and dodging the forces of\nhistory instead of making a dominating stand.\nA train came. I followed them inside. There were many seats and the\nthree sat together. I stood, holding onto the center pole, looking down the\nlength of the car. On one side I saw a white nun in black telling her beads,\nand standing before the door across the aisle there was another dressed\ncompletely in white, the exact duplicate of the other except that she was\nblack and her black feet bare. Neither of the nuns was looking at the other\nbut at their crucifixes, and suddenly I laughed and a verse I\'d heard long ago\nat the Golden Day paraphrased itself in my mind:\nBread and Wine,\nBread and Wine,\nYour cross ain\'t nearly so\nHeavy as mine . . .\nAnd the nuns rode on with lowered heads.\nI looked at the boys. They sat as formally as they walked. From time\nto time one of them would look at his reflection in the window and give his\nhat brim a snap, the others watching him silently, communicating ironically\nwith their eyes, then looking straight ahead. I staggered with the lunging of\nthe train, feeling the overhead fans driving the hot air down upon me. What\nwas I in relation to the boys, I wondered. Perhaps an accident, like Douglass.\nPerhaps each hundred years or so men like them, like me, appeared in\nsociety, drifting through; and yet by all historical logic we, I, should have\ndisappeared around the first part of the nineteenth century, rationalized out of\nexistence. Perhaps, like them, I was a throwback, a small distant meteorite\nthat died several hundred years ago and now lived only by virtue of the light\nthat speeds through space at too great a pace to realize that its source has\nbecome a piece of lead . . . This was silly, such thoughts. I looked at the\nboys; one tapped another on the knee, and I saw him remove three rolled\nmagazines from an inner pocket, passing two around and keeping one for\nhimself. The others took theirs silently and began to read in complete\nabsorption. One held his magazine high before his face and for an instant I\nsaw a vivid scene: The shining rails, the fire hydrant, the fallen policeman,\nthe diving birds and in the mid-ground, Clifton, crumpling. Then I saw the\ncover of a comic book and thought, Clifton would have known them better\nthan I. He knew them all the time. I studied them closely until they left the\ntrain, their shoulders rocking, their heavy heel plates clicking remote, cryptic\nmessages in the brief silence of the train\'s stop.\nI came out of the subway, weak, moving through the heat as though\nI carried a heavy stone, the weight of a mountain on my shoulders. My new\nshoes hurt my feet. Now, moving through the crowds along 125th Street, I\nwas painfully aware of other men dressed like the boys, and of girls in dark\nexotic-colored stockings, their costumes surreal variations of downtown styles.\nThey\'d been there all along, but somehow I\'d missed them. I\'d missed them\neven when my work had been most successful. They were outside the groove\nof history, and it was my job to get them in, all of them. I looked into the\ndesign of their faces, hardly a one that was unlike someone I\'d known down\nSouth. Forgotten names sang through my head like forgotten scenes in\ndreams. I moved with the crowd, the sweat pouring off me, listening to the\ngrinding roar of traffic, the growing sound of a record shop loudspeaker\nblaring a languid blues. I stopped. Was this all that would be recorded? Was\nthis the only true history of the times, a mood blared by trumpets,\ntrombones, saxophones and drums, a song with turgid, inadequate words? My\nmind flowed. It was as though in this short block I was forced to walk past\neveryone I\'d ever known and no one would smile or call my name. No one\nfixed me in his eyes. I walked in feverish isolation. Near the corner now a\ncouple of boys darted out of the Five and Ten with handfuls of candy bars,\ndropping them along the walks as they ran with a man right behind. They\ncame toward me, pumping past, and I killed an impulse to trip the man and\nwas confused all the more when an old woman standing further along threw\nout her leg and swung a heavy bag. The man went down, sliding across the\nwalk as she shook her head in triumph. A pressure of guilt came over me. I\nstood on the edge of the walk watching the crowd threatening to attack the\nman until a policeman appeared and dispersed them. And although I knew no\none man could do much about it, I felt responsible. All our work had been\nvery little, no great change had been made. And it was all my fault. I\'d been\nso fascinated by the motion that I\'d forgotten to measure what it was\nbringing forth. I\'d been asleep, dreaming.\nChapter 21\nWhen I got back to the district a small group of youth members\nstopped their joking to welcome me, but I couldn\'t break the news. I went\nthrough to the office with only a nod, shutting the door upon their voices\nand sat staring out through the trees. The once fresh green of the trees was\ndark and drying now and somewhere down below a clothesline peddler\nclanged his bell and called. Then, as I fought against it, the scene came back\n-- not of the death, but of the dolls. Why had I lost my head and spat upon\nthe doll, I wondered. What had Clifton felt when he saw me? He must have\nhated me behind his spiel, yet he\'d ignored me. Yes, and been amused by my\npolitical stupidity. I had blown up and acted personally instead of denouncing\nthe significance of the dolls, him, the obscene idea, and seizing the\nopportunity to educate the crowd. We lost no opportunity to educate, and I\nhad failed. All I\'d done was to make them laugh all the louder . . . I had\naided and abetted social backwardness . . . The scene changed -- he lay in\nthe sun and this time I saw a trail of smoke left by a sky-writing plane\nlingering in the sky, a large woman in a kelly-green dress stood near me\nsaying, "Oh, Oh!" . . .\nI turned and faced the map, removing the doll from my pocket and\ntossing it upon the desk. My stomach surged. To die for such a thing! I\npicked it up with an unclean feeling, looked at the frilled paper. The joined\ncardboard feet hung down, pulling the paper legs in elastic folds, a\nconstruction of tissue, cardboard and glue. And yet I felt a hatred as for\nsomething alive. What had made it seem to dance? Its cardboard hands were\ndoubled into fists, the fingers outlined in orange paint, and I noticed that it\nhad two faces, one on either side of the disk of cardboard, and both grinning.\nClifton\'s voice came to me as he spieled his directions for making it dance,\nand I held it by the feet and stretched its neck, seeing it crumple and slide\nforward. I tried again, turning its other face around. It gave a tired bounce,\nshook itself and fell in a heap.\n"Go on, entertain me," I said, giving it a stretch. "You entertained\nthe crowd." I turned it around. One face grinned as broadly as the other. It\nhad grinned back at Clifton as it grinned forward at the crowd, and their\nentertainment had been his death. It had still grinned when I played the tool\nand spat upon it, and it was still grinning when Clifton ignored me. Then I\nsaw a fine black thread and pulled it from the trilled paper. There was a\nloop tied in the end. I slipped it over my finger and stood stretching it taut.\nAnd this time it danced. Clifton had been making it dance all the time and\nthe black thread had been invisible.\nWhy didn\'t you hit him? I asked myself; try to break his jaw? Why\ndidn\'t you hurt him and save him? You might have started a fight and both\nof you would have been arrested with no shooting . . . But why had he\nresisted the cop anyway? He\'d been arrested before; he knew how far to go\nwith a cop. What had the cop said to make him angry enough to lose his\nhead? And suddenly it occurred to me that he might have been angry before\nhe resisted, before he\'d even seen the cop. My breath became short; I felt\nmyself go weak. What if he believed I\'d sold out? It was a sickening thought.\nI sat holding myself as though I might break. For a moment I weighed the\nidea, but it was too big for me. I could only accept responsibility for the\nliving, not for the dead. My mind backed away from the notion. The incident\nwas political. I looked at the doll, thinking, The political equivalent of such\nentertainment is death. But that\'s too broad a definition. Its economic\nmeaning? That the lite of a man is worth the sale of a two-bit paper doll . .\n. But that didn\'t kill the idea that my anger helped speed him on to death.\nAnd still my mind fought against it. For what had I to do with the crisis that\nhad broken his integrity? What had I to do with his selling the dolls in the\nfirst place? And finally I had to give that up too. I was no detective, and,\npolitically, individuals were without meaning. The shooting was all that was\nleft of him now, Clifton had chosen to plunge out of history and, except for\nthe picture it made in my mind\'s eye, only the plunge was recorded, and that\nwas the only important thing.\nI sat rigid, as though waiting to hear the explosions again, fighting\nagainst the weight that seemed to pull me down. I heard the clothesline\npeddler\'s bell . . . What would I tell the committee when the newspaper\naccounts were out? To hell with them. How would I explain the dolls? But\nwhy should I say anything? What could we do to fight back. That was my\nworry. The bell tolled again in the yard below. I looked at the doll. I could\nthink of no justification for Clifton\'s having sold the dolls, but there was\njustification enough for giving him a public funeral, and I seized upon the\nidea now as though it would save my life. Even though I wanted to turn\naway from it as I\'d wanted to turn from Clifton\'s crumpled body on the walk.\nBut the odds against us were too great for such weakness. We had to use\nevery politically effective weapon against them; Clifton understood that. He\nhad to be buried and I knew of no relatives; someone had to see that he was\nplaced in the ground. Yes, the dolls were obscene and his act a betrayal. But\nhe was only a salesman, not the inventor, and it was necessary that we make\nit known that the meaning of his death was greater than the incident or the\nobject that caused it. Both as a means of avenging him and of preventing\nother such deaths . . . yes, and of attracting lost members back into the\nranks. It would be ruthless, but a ruthlessness in the interest of Brotherhood,\nfor we had only our minds and bodies, as against the other side\'s vast power.\nWe had to make the most of what we had. For they had the power to use a\npaper doll, first to destroy his integrity and then as an excuse for killing him.\nAll right, so we\'ll use his funeral to put his integrity together again . . . For\nthat\'s all that he had had or wanted. And now I could see the doll only\nvaguely and drops of moisture were thudding down upon its absorbent paper\n. . .\nI was bent over, staring, when the knock came at the door and I\njumped as at a shot, sweeping the doll into my pocket, and hastily wiping my\neyes.\n"Come in," I said.\nThe door opened slowly. A group of youth members crowded forward,\ntheir faces a question. The girls were crying.\n"Is it true?" they said.\n"That he is dead? Yes," I said, looking among them. "Yes."\n"But why . . . ?"\n"It was a case of provocation and murder!" I said, my emotions\nbeginning to turn to anger.\nThey stood there, their faces questioning me.\n"He\'s dead," a girl said, her voice without conviction. "Dead."\n"But what do they mean about his selling dolls?" a tall youth said.\n"I don\'t know," I said. "I only know that he was shot down.\nUnarmed. I know how you feel, I saw him fall."\n"Take me home," a girl screamed. "Take me home!"\nI stepped forward and caught her, a little brown thing in bobby\nsocks, holding her against me. "No, we can\'t go home," I said, "none of us.\nWe\'ve got to fight. I\'d like to get out into the air and forget it, if I ever\ncould. What we want is not tears but anger. We must remember now that we\nare fighters, and in such incidents we must see the meaning of our struggle.\nWe must strike back. I want each of you to round up all the members you\ncan. We\'ve got to make our reply."\nOne of the girls was still crying piteously when they went out, but\nthey were moving quickly.\n"Come on, Shirley," they said, taking the girl from my shoulder.\nI tried to get in touch with headquarters, but again I was unable to\nreach anyone. I called the Chthonian but there was no answer. So I called a\ncommittee of the district\'s leading members and we moved slowly ahead on\nour own. I tried to find the youth who was with Clifton, but he had\ndisappeared. Members were set on the streets with cans to solicit funds for\nhis burial. A committee of three old women went to the morgue to claim his\nbody. We distributed black-bordered leaflets, denouncing the police\ncommissioner. Preachers were notified to have their congregations send letters\nof protest to the mayor. The story spread. A photograph of Clifton was sent\nto the Negro papers and published. People were stirred and angry. Street\nmeetings were organized. And, released (by the action) from my indecision, I\nthrew everything I had into organizing the funeral, though moving in a kind\nof numb suspension. I didn\'t go to bed for two days and nights, but caught\ncatnaps at my desk. I ate very little.\nTHE funeral was arranged to attract the largest number. Instead of\nholding it in a church or chapel, we selected Mount Morris Park, and an\nappeal went out for all former members to join the funeral march.\nIt took place on a Saturday, in the heat of the afternoon. There was\na thin overcast of clouds, and hundreds of people formed for the procession.\nI went around giving orders and encouragement in a feverish daze, and yet\nseeming to observe it all from off to one side. Brothers and sisters turned up\nwhom I hadn\'t seen since my return. And members from downtown and\noutlying districts. I watched them with surprise as they gathered and\nwondered at the depths of their sorrow as the lines began to form.\nThere were half-draped flags and black banners. There were\nblack-bordered signs that read:\nBROTHER TOD CLIFTON\nOUR HOPE SHOT DOWN\nThere was a hired drum corps with crape-draped drums. There was a\nband of thirty pieces. There were no cars and very few flowers.\nIt was a slow procession and the band played sad, romantic, military\nmarches. And when the band was silent the drum corps beat the time on\ndrums with muffled heads. It was hot and explosive, and delivery men\navoided the district and the police details were increased in number. And up\nand down the streets people looked out of their apartment windows and men\nand boys stood on the roofs in the thin-veiled sun. I marched at the head\nwith the old community leaders. It was a slow march and as I looked back\nfrom time to time I could see young zoot-suiters, hep cats, and men in\noveralls and pool-hall gamblers stepping into the procession. Men came out of\nbarber shops with lathered faces, their neckcloths hanging, to watch and\ncomment in hushed voices. And I wondered, Are they all Clifton\'s friends, or\nis it just for the spectacle, the slow-paced music? A hot wind blew from\nbehind me, bringing the sick sweetish odor, like the smell of some female\ndogs in season.\nI looked back. The sun shone down on a mass of unbared heads,\nand above flags and banners and shining horns I could see the cheap gray\ncoffin moving high upon the shoulders of Clifton\'s tallest companions, who\nfrom time to time shifted it smoothly on to others. They bore him high and\nthey bore him proudly and there was an angry sadness in their eyes. The\ncoffin floated like a heavily loaded ship in a channel, winding its way slowly\nabove the bowed and submerged heads. I could hear the steady rolling of the\ndrums with muffled snares, and all other sounds were suspended in silence.\nBehind, the tramp of feet; ahead, the crowds lining the curbs for blocks.\nThere were tears and muffled sobs and many hard, red eyes. We moved\nahead.\nWe wound through the poorest streets at first, a black image of\nsorrow, then turned into Seventh Avenue and down and over to Lenox. Then\nI hurried with the leading brothers to the park in a cab. A brother in the\nPark Department had opened the lookout tower, and a crude platform of\nplanks and ranked saw horses had been erected beneath the black iron bell,\nand when the procession started into the park we were standing high above,\nwaiting. At our signal he struck the bell, and I could feel my eardrums\nthrobbing with the old, hollow, gut-vibrant Doom-Dong-Doom.\nLooking down, I could see them winding upward in a mass to the\nmuffled sound of the drums. Children stopped their playing on the grass to\nstare, and nurses at the nearby hospital came out on the roof to watch, their\nwhite uniforms glowing in the now unveiled sun like lilies. And crowds\napproached the park from all directions. The muffled drums now beating, now\nsteadily rolling, spread a dead silence upon the air, a prayer tor the unknown\nsoldier. And looking down I felt a lostness. Why were they here? Why had\nthey found us? Because they knew Clifton? Or for the occasion his death gave\nthem to express their protestations, a time and place to come together, to\nstand touching and sweating and breathing and looking in a common\ndirection? Was either explanation adequate in itself? Did it signify love or\npoliticalized hate? And could politics ever be an expression of love?\nOver the park the silence spread from the slow muffled rolling of the\ndrums, the crunching of footsteps on the walks. Then somewhere in the\nprocession an old, plaintive, masculine voice arose in a song, wavering,\nstumbling in the silence at first alone, until in the band a euphonium horn\nfumbled for the key and took up the air, one catching and rising above the\nother and the other pursuing, two black pigeons rising above a skull-white\nbarn to tumble and rise through still, blue air. And for a few bars the pure\nsweet tone of the horn and the old man\'s husky baritone sang a duet in the\nhot heavy silence. "There\'s Many a Thousand Gone." And standing high up\nover the park something fought in my throat. It was a song from the past,\nthe past of the campus and the still earlier past of home. And now some of\nthe older ones in the mass were joining in. I hadn\'t thought of it as a march\nbefore, but now they were marching to its slow-paced rhythm, up the hill. I\nlooked for the euphonium player and saw a slender black man with his face\nturned toward the sun, singing through the upturned bells of the horn. And\nseveral yards behind, marching beside the young men floating the coffin\nupward, I looked into the face of the old man who had aroused the song and\nfelt a twinge of envy. It was a worn, old, yellow face and his eyes were\nclosed and I could see a knife welt around his upturned neck as his throat\nthrew out the song. He sang with his whole body, phrasing each verse as\nnaturally as he walked, his voice rising above all the others, blending with\nthat of the lucid horn. I watched him now, wet-eyed, the sun hot upon my\nhead, and I felt a wonder at the singing mass. It was as though the song had\nbeen there all the time and he knew it and aroused it; and I knew that I\nhad known it too and had failed to release it out of a vague, nameless shame\nor fear. But he had known and aroused it. Even white brothers and sisters\nwere joining in. I looked into that face, trying to plumb its secret, but it told\nme nothing. I looked at the coffin and the marchers, listening to them, and\nyet realizing that I was listening to something within myself, and for a second\nI heard the shattering stroke of my heart. Something deep had shaken the\ncrowd, and the old man and the man with the horn had done it. They had\ntouched upon something deeper than protest, or religion; though now images\nof all the church meetings of my life welled up within me with much\nsuppressed and forgotten anger. But that was past, and too many of those\nnow reaching the top of the mountain and spreading massed together had\nnever shared it, and some had been born in other lands. And yet all were\ntouched; the song had aroused us all. It was not the words, for they were all\nthe same old slave-borne words; it was as though he\'d changed the emotion\nbeneath the words while yet the old longing, resigned, transcendent emotion\nstill sounded above, now deepened by that something for which the theory of\nBrotherhood had given me no name. I stood there trying to contain it as they\nbrought Tod Clifton\'s coffin into the tower and slowly up the spiral stairs.\nThey set it down upon the platform and I looked at the shape of the cheap\ngray coffin and all I could remember was the sound of his name.\nThe song had ended. Now the top of the little mountain bristled with\nbanners, horns and uplifted faces. I could look straight down Fifth Avenue to\n125th Street, where policemen were lined behind an array ot hot-dog wagons\nand Good Humor carts; and among the carts I saw a peanut vendor standing\nbeneath a street lamp upon which pigeons were gathered, and now I saw him\nstretch out his arms with his palms turned upward, and suddenly he was\ncovered, head, shoulders and outflung arms, with fluttering, feasting birds.\nSomeone nudged me and I started. It was time for final words. But I\nhad no words and I\'d never been to a Brotherhood funeral and had no idea\nof a ritual. But they were waiting. I stood there alone; there was no\nmicrophone to support me, only the coffin before me upon the backs of its\nwobbly carpenter\'s horses.\nI looked down into their sun-swept faces, digging for the words, and\nfeeling a futility about it all and an anger. For this they gathered by\nthousands. What were they waiting to hear? Why had they come? For what\nreason that was different from that which had made the red-cheeked boy\nthrill at Clifton\'s falling to the earth? What did they want and what could\nthey do? Why hadn\'t they come when they could have stopped it all?\n"What are you waiting for me to tell you?" I shouted suddenly, my\nvoice strangely crisp on the windless air. "What good will it do? What if I\nsay that this isn\'t a funeral, that it\'s a holiday celebration, that if you stick\naround the band will end up playing \'Damit-the-Hell the Fun\'s All Over\'? Or\ndo you expect to see some magic, the dead rise up and walk again? Go\nhome, he\'s as dead as he\'ll ever die. That\'s the end in the beginning and\nthere\'s no encore. There\'ll be no miracles and there\'s no one here to preach a\nsermon. Go home, forget him. He\'s inside this box, newly dead. Go home and\ndon\'t think about him. He\'s dead and you\'ve got all you can do to think\nabout you." I paused. They were whispering and looking upward.\n"I\'ve told you to go home," I shouted, "but you keep standing there.\nDon\'t you know it\'s hot out here in the sun? So what if you wait for what\nlittle I can tell you? Can I say in twenty minutes what was building\ntwenty-one years and ended in twenty seconds? What are you waiting for,\nwhen all I can tell you is his name? And when I tell you, what will you\nknow that you didn\'t know already, except perhaps, his name?"\nThey were listening intently, and as though looking not at me, but at\nthe pattern of my voice upon the air.\n"All right, you do the listening in the sun and I\'ll try to tell you in\nthe sun. Then you go home and forget it. Forget it. His name was Clifton\nand they shot him down. His name was Clifton and he was tall and some\nfolks thought him handsome. And though he didn\'t belilve it, I think he was.\nHis name was Clifton and his face was black and his hair was thick with\ntight-rolled curls -- or call them naps or kinks. He\'s dead, uninterested, and,\nexcept to a few young girls, it doesn\'t matter . . . Have you got it? Can you\nsee him? Think of your brother or your cousin John. His lips were thick with\nan upward curve at the corners. He often smiled. He had good eyes and a\npair of fast hands, and he had a heart. He thought about things and he felt\ndeeply. I won\'t call him noble because what\'s such a word to do with one of\nus? His name was Clifton, Tod Clifton, and, like any man, he was born of\nwoman to live awhile and fall and die. So that\'s his tale to the minute. His\nname was Clifton and for a while he lived among us and aroused a few\nhopes in the young manhood of man, and we who knew him loved him and\nhe died. So why are you waiting? You\'ve heard it all. Why wait for more,\nwhen all I can do is repeat it?"\nThey stood; they listened. They gave no sign.\n"Very well, so I\'ll tell you. His name was Clifton and he was young\nand he was a leader and when he fell there was a hole in the heel of his\nsock and when he stretched forward he seemed not as tall as when he stood.\nSo he died; and we who loved him are gathered here to mourn him. It\'s as\nsimple as that and as short as that. His name was Clifton and he was black\nand they shot him. Isn\'t that enough to tell? Isn\'t it all you need to know?\nIsn\'t that enough to appease your thirst for drama and send you home to\nsleep it off? Go take a drink and forget it. Or read it in The Daily News. His\nname was Clifton and they shot him, and I was there to see him fall. So I\nknow it as I know it.\n"Here are the facts. He was standing and he fell. He fell and he\nkneeled. He kneeled and he bled. He bled and he died. He tell in a heap like\nany man and his blood spilled out like any blood; red as any blood, wet as\nany blood and reflecting the sky and the buildings and birds and trees, or\nyour face if you\'d looked into its dulling mirror -- and it dried in the sun as\nblood dries. That\'s all. They spilled his blood and he bled. They cut him\ndown and he died; the blood flowed on the walk in a pool, gleamed a while,\nand, after awhile, became dull then dusty, then dried. That\'s the story and\nthat\'s how it ended. It\'s an old story and there\'s been too much blood to\nexcite you. Besides, it\'s only important when it fills the veins of a living man.\nAren\'t you tired of such stories? Aren\'t you sick of the blood? Then why\nlisten, why don\'t you go? It\'s hot out here. There\'s the odor of embalming\nfluid. The beer is cold in the taverns, the saxophones will be mellow at the\nSavoy; plenty good-laughing-lies will be told in the barber shops and beauty\nparlors; and there\'ll be sermons in two hundred churches in the cool of the\nevening, and plenty of laughs at the movies. Go listen to \'Amos and Andy\'\nand forget it. Here you have only the same old story. There\'s not even a\nyoung wife up here in red to mourn him. There\'s nothing here to pity, no\none to break down and shout. Nothing to give you that good old frightened\nfeeling. The story\'s too short and too simple. His name was Clifton, Tod\nClifton, he was unarmed and his death was as senseless as his life was futile.\nHe had struggled for Brotherhood on a hundred street corners and he\nthought it would make him more human, but he died like any dog in a road.\n"All right, all right," I called out, feeling desperate. It wasn\'t the way\nI wanted it to go, it wasn\'t political. Brother Jack probably wouldn\'t approve\nof it at all, but I had to keep going as I could go.\n"Listen to me standing up on this so-called mountain!" I shouted.\n"Let me tell it as it truly was! His name was Tod Clifton and he was full of\nillusions. He thought he was a man when he was only Tod Clifton. He was\nshot for a simple mistake of judgment and he bled and his blood dried and\nshortly the crowd trampled out the stains. It was a normal mistake of which\nmany are guilty: He thought he was a man and that men were not meant to\nbe pushed around. But it was hot downtown and he forgot his history, he\nforgot the time and the place. He lost his hold on reality. There was a cop\nand a waiting audience but he was Tod Clifton and cops are everywhere. The\ncop? What about him? He was a cop. A good citizen. But this cop had an\nitching finger and an eager ear for a word that rhymed with \'trigger,\' and\nwhen Clifton fell he had found it. The Police Special spoke its lines and the\nrhyme was completed. Just look around you. Look at what he made, look\ninside you and feel his awful power. It was perfectly natural. The blood ran\nlike blood in a comic-book killing, on a comic-book street in a comic-book\ntown on a comic-book day in a comic-book world.\n"Tod Clifton\'s one with the ages. But what\'s that to do with you in\nthis heat under this veiled sun? Now he\'s part of history, and he has received\nhis true freedom. Didn\'t they scribble his name on a standardized pad? His\nRace: colored! Religion: unknown, probably born Baptist. Place of birth: U.S.\nSome southern town. Next of kin: unknown. Address: unknown. Occupation:\nunemployed. Cause of death (be specific): resisting reality in the form of a\n.38 caliber revolver in the hands of the arresting officer, on Forty-second\nbetween the library and the subway in the heat of the afternoon, of gunshot\nwounds received from three bullets, fired at three paces, one bullet entering\nthe right ventricle of the heart, and lodging there, the other severing the\nspinal ganglia traveling downward to lodge in the pelvis, the other breaking\nthrough the back and traveling God knows where.\n"Such was the short bitter life of Brother Tod Clifton. Now he\'s in\nthis box with the bolts tightened down. He\'s in the box and we\'re in there\nwith him, and when I\'ve told you this you can go. It\'s dark in this box and\nit\'s crowded. It has a cracked ceiling and a clogged-up toilet in the hall. It\nhas rats and roaches, and it\'s far, far too expensive a dwelling. The air is bad\nand it\'ll be cold this winter. Tod Clifton is crowded and he needs the room.\n\'Tell them to get out of the box,\' that\'s what he would say if you could hear\nhim. \'Tell them to get out of the box and go teach the cops to forget that\nrhyme. Tell them to teach them that when they call you nigger to make a\nrhyme with trigger it makes the gun backfire.\'\n"So there you have it. In a few hours Tod Clifton will be cold bones\nin the ground. And don\'t be fooled, for these bones shall not rise again. You\nand I will still be in the box. I don\'t know if Tod Clifton had a soul. I only\nknow the ache that I feel in my heart, my sense of loss. I don\'t know if you\nhave a soul. I only know you are men of flesh and blood; and that blood will\nspill and flesh grow cold. I do not know if all cops are poets, but I know\nthat all cops carry guns with triggers. And I know too how we are labeled.\nSo in the name of Brother Clifton beware of the triggers; go home, keep cool,\nstay safe away from the sun. Forget him. When he was alive he was our\nhope, but why worry over a hope that\'s dead? So there\'s only one thing left\nto tell and I\'ve already told it. His name was Tod Clifton, he believed in\nBrotherhood, he aroused our hopes and he died."\nI couldn\'t go on. Below, they were waiting, hands and handkerchiefs\nshading their eyes. A preacher stepped up and read something out of his\nBible, and I stood looking at the crowd with a sense of failure. I had let it\nget away from me, had been unable to bring in the political issues. And they\nstood there sun-beaten and sweat-bathed, listening to me repeat what was\nknown. Now the preacher had finished, and someone signaled the bandmaster\nand there was solemn music as the pallbearers carried the coffin down the\nspiraling stairs. The crowd stood still as we walked slowly through. I could\nfeel the bigness of it and the unknownness of it and a pent-up tension --\nwhether of tears or anger, I couldn\'t tell. But as we walked through and\ndown the hill to the hearse, I could feel it. The crowd sweated and throbbed,\nand though it was silent, there were many things directed toward me through\nits eyes. At the curb were the hearse and a few cars, and in a few minutes\nthey were loaded and the crowd was still standing, looking on as we carried\nTod Clifton away. And as I took one last look I saw not a crowd but the set\nfaces of individual men and women.\nWe drove away and when the cars stopped moving there was a grave\nand we placed him in it. The gravediggers sweated heavily and knew their\nbusiness and their brogue was Irish. They filled the grave quickly and we left.\nTod Clifton was underground.\nI returned through the streets as tired as though I\'d dug the grave\nmyself alone. I felt confused and listless moving through the crowds that\nseemed to boil along in a kind of mist, as though the thin humid clouds had\nthickened and settled directly above our heads. I wanted to go somewhere, to\nsome cool place to rest without thinking, but there was still too much to be\ndone; plans had to be made; the crowd\'s emotion had to be organized. I\ncrept along, walking a southern walk in southern weather, closing my eyes\nfrom time to time against the dazzling reds, yellows and greens of cheap\nsport shirts and summer dresses. The crowd boiled, sweated, heaved; women\nwith shopping bags, men with highly polished shoes. Even down South they\'d\nalways shined their shoes. "Shined shoes, shoed shines," it rang in my head.\nOn Eighth Avenue, the market carts were parked hub to hub along the curb,\nimprovised canopies shading the withering fruits and vegetables. I could smell\nthe stench of decaying cabbage. A watermelon huckster stood in the shade\nbeside his truck, holding up a long slice of orange-mealed melon, crying his\nwares with hoarse appeals to nostalgia, memories of childhood, green shade\nand summer coolness. Oranges, cocoanuts and alligator pears lay in neat piles\non little tables. I passed, winding my way through the slowly moving crowd.\nStale and wilted flowers, rejected downtown, blazed feverishly on a cart, like\nglamorous rags festering beneath a futile spray from a punctured fruit juice\ncan. The crowd were boiling figures seen through steaming glass from inside\na washing machine; and in the streets the mounted police detail stood looking\non, their eyes noncommittal beneath the short polished visors of their caps,\ntheir bodies slanting forward, reins slackly alert, men and horses of flesh\nimitating men and horses of stone. Tod Clifton\'s Tod, I thought. The\nhucksters cried above the traffic sounds and I seemed to hear them from a\ndistance, unsure of what they said. In a side street children with warped\ntricycles were parading along the walk carrying one of the signs, BROTHER\nTOD CLIFTON, OUR HOPE SHOT DOWN.\nAnd through the haze I again felt the tension. There was no denying\nit; it was there and something had to be done before it simmered away in\nthe heat.\nChapter 22\nWhen I saw them sitting in their shirtsleeves, leaning forward,\ngripping their crossed knees with their hands, I wasn\'t surprised. I\'m glad it\'s\nyou, I thought, this will be business without tears. It was as though I had\nexpected to find them there, just as in those dreams in which I encountered\nmy grandfather looking at me from across the dimensionless space of a\ndream-room. I looked back without surprise or emotion, although I knew even\nin the dream that surprise was the normal reaction and that the lack of it\nwas to be distrusted, a warning.\nI stood just inside the room, watching them as I slipped off my\njacket, seeing them grouped around a small table upon which there rested a\npitcher of water, a glass and a couple of smoking ash trays. One half of the\nroom was dark and only one light burned, directly above the table. They\nregarded me silently, Brother Jack with a smile that went no deeper than his\nlips, his head cocked to one side, studying me with his penetrating eyes; the\nothers blank-faced, looking out of eyes that were meant to reveal nothing and\nto stir profound uncertainty. The smoke rose in spirals from their cigarettes\nas they sat perfectly contained, waiting. So you came, after all, I thought,\ngoing over and dropping into one of the chairs. I rested my arm on the\ntable, noticing its coolness.\n"Well, how did it go?" Brother Jack said, extending his clasped hands\nacross the table and looking at me with his head to one side.\n"You saw the crowd," I said. "We finally got them out."\n"No, we did not see the crowd. How was it?"\n"They were moved," I said, "a great number of them. But beyond\nthat I don\'t know. They were with us, but how far I don\'t know . . ." And\nfor a moment I could hear my own voice in the quiet of the high-ceilinged\nhall.\n"Sooo! Is that all the great tactician has to tell us?" Brother Tobitt\nsaid. "In what direction were they moved?"\nI looked at him, aware of the numbness of my emotions; they had\nflowed in one channel too long and too deeply.\n"That\'s for the committee to decide. They were aroused, that was all\nwe could do. We tried again and again to reach the committee for guidance\nbut we couldn\'t."\n"So?"\n"So we went ahead on my personal responsibility."\nBrother Jack\'s eyes narrowed. "What was that?" he said. "Your what?"\n"My personal responsibility," I said.\n"His personal responsibility," Brother Jack said. "Did you hear that,\nBrothers? Did I hear him correctly. Where did you get it, Brother?" he said.\n"This is astounding, where did you get it?"\n"From your ma --" I started and caught myself in time. "From the\ncommittee," I said.\nThere was a pause. I looked at him, his face reddening, as I tried to\nget my bearings. A nerve trembled in the center of my stomach.\n"Everyone came out," I said, trying to fill it in. "We saw the\nopportunity and the community agreed with us. It\'s too bad you missed it . .\n."\n"You see, he\'s sorry we missed it," Brother Jack said. He held up his\nhand. I could see the deeply etched lines in his palm. "The great tactician of\npersonal responsibility regrets our absence . . ."\nDoesn\'t he see how I feel, I thought, can\'t he see why I did it?\nWhat\'s he trying to do? Tobitt\'s a fool, but why is he taking it up?\n"You could have taken the next step," I said, forcing the words. "We\nwent as far as we could . . ."\n"On your personal re-spon-si-bility," Brother Jack said, bowing his\nhead in time with the words.\nI looked at him steadily now. "I was told to win back our following,\nso I tried. The only way I knew how. What\'s your criticism? What\'s wrong?"\n"So now," he said, rubbing his eye with a delicate circular movement\nof his fist, "the great tactician asks what\'s wrong. Is it possible that\nsomething could be wrong? Do you hear him, Brothers?"\nThere was a cough. Someone poured a glass of water and I could\nhear it fill up very fast, then the rapid rill-like trickle of the final drops\ndripping from the pitcher-lip into the glass. I looked at him, my mind trying\nto bring things into focus.\n"You mean he admits the possibility of being incorrect?" Tobitt said.\n"Sheer modesty, Brother. The sheerest modesty. We have here an\nextraordinary tactician, a Napoleon of strategy and personal responsibility.\n\'Strike while the iron is hot\' is his motto. \'Seize the instance by its throat,\'\n\'Shoot at the whites of their eyes,\' \'Give \'em the ax, the ax, the ax,\' and so\nforth."\nI stood up. "I don\'t know what this is all about, Brother. What are\nyou trying to say?"\n"Now there is a good question, Brothers. Sit down, please, it\'s hot.\nHe wants to know what we\'re trying to say. We have here not only an\nextraordinary tactician, but one who has an appreciation for subtleties of\nexpression."\n"Yes, and for sarcasm, when it\'s good," I said.\n"And for discipline? Sit down, please, it\'s hot . . ."\n"And for discipline. And for orders and consultation when it\'s\npossible to have them," I said.\nBrother Jack grinned. "Sit down, sit down -- And for patience?"\n"When I\'m not sleepy and exhausted," I said, "and not overheated as\nI am just now."\n"You\'ll learn," he said. "You\'ll learn and you\'ll surrender yourself to it\neven under such conditions. Especially under such conditions; that\'s its value.\nThat makes it patience."\n"Yes, I guess I\'m learning now," I said. "Right now."\n"Brother," he said drily, "you have no idea how much you\'re learning\n-- Please sit down."\n"All right," I said, sitting down again. "But while ignoring my\npersonal education for a second I\'d like you to remember that the people\nhave little patience with us these days. We could use this time more\nprofitably."\n"And I could tell you that politicians are not personal persons,"\nBrother Jack said, "but I won\'t. How could we use it more profitably?"\n"By organizing their anger."\n"So again our great tactician has relieved himself. Today he\'s a busy\nman. First an oration over the body of Brutus, and now a lecture on the\npatience of the Negro people."\nTobitt was enjoying himself. I could see his cigarette tremble in his\nlips as he struck a match to light it.\n"I move we issue his remarks in a pamphlet," he said, running his\nfinger over his chin. "They should create a natural phenomenon . . ."\nThis had better stop right here, I thought. My head was getting\nlighter and my chest felt tight.\n"Look," I said, "an unarmed man was killed. A brother, a leading\nmember shot down by a policeman. We had lost our prestige in the\ncommunity. I saw the chance to rally the people, so I acted. If that was\nincorrect, then I did wrong, so say it straight without this crap. It\'ll take\nmore than sarcasm to deal with that crowd out there."\nBrother Jack reddened; the others exchanged glances.\n"He hasn\'t read the newspapers," someone said.\n"You forget," Brother Jack said, "it wasn\'t necessary; he was there."\n"Yes, I was there," I said. "If you\'re referring to the killing."\n"There, you see," Brother Jack said. "He was on the scene."\nBrother Tobitt pushed the table edge with his palms. "And still you\norganized that side show of a funeral!"\nMy nose twitched. I turned toward him deliberately, forcing a grin.\n"How could there be a side show without you as the star attraction,\nwho\'d draw the two bits admission, Brother Twobits? What was wrong with\nthe funeral?"\n"Now we\'re making progress," Brother Jack said, straddling his chair.\n"The strategist has raised a very interesting question. What\'s wrong, he asks.\nAll right, I\'ll answer. Under your leadership, a traitorous merchant of vile\ninstruments of anti-Negro, anti-minority racist bigotry has received the funeral\nof a hero. Do you still ask what\'s wrong?"\n"But nothing was done about a traitor," I said.\nHe half-stood, gripping the back of his chair. "We all heard you\nadmit it."\n"We dramatized the shooting down of an unarmed black man."\nHe threw up his hands. To hell with you, I thought. To hell with\nyou. He was a man!\n"That black man, as you call him, was a traitor," Brother Jack said.\n"A traitor!"\n"What is a traitor, Brother?" I asked, feeling an angry amusement as\nI counted on my fingers. "He was a man and a Negro; a man and a brother;\na man and a traitor, as you say; then he was a dead man, and alive or dead\nhe was jam-full of contradictions. So full that he attracted half of Harlem to\ncome out and stand in the sun in answer to our call. So what is a traitor?"\n"So now he retreats," Brother Jack said. "Observe him, Brothers.\nAfter putting the movement in the position of forcing a traitor down the\nthroats of the Negroes he asks what a traitor is."\n"Yes," I said. "Yes, and, as you say, it\'s a fair question, Brother.\nSome folks call me traitor because I\'ve been working downtown; some would\ncall me a traitor if I was in Civil Service and others if I simply sat in my\ncorner and kept quiet. Sure, I considered what Clifton did --"\n"And you defend him!"\n"Not for that. I was as disgusted as you. But hell, isn\'t the shooting\nof an unarmed man of more importance politically than the fact that he sold\nobscene dolls?"\n"So you exercised your personal responsibility," Jack said.\n"That\'s all I had to go on. I wasn\'t called to the strategy meeting,\nremember."\n"Didn\'t you see what you were playing with?" Tobitt said. "Have you\nno respect for your people?"\n"It was a dangerous mistake to give you the opportunity," one of the\nothers said.\nI looked across at him. "The committee can take it away, if it wishes.\nBut meantime, why is everyone so upset? If even one-tenth of the people\nlooked at the dolls as we do, our work would be a lot easier. The dolls are\nnothing."\n"Nothing," Jack said. "That nothing that might explode in our face."\nI sighed. "Your faces are safe, Brother," I said. "Can\'t you see that\nthey don\'t think in such abstract terms? If they did, perhaps the new\nprogram wouldn\'t have flopped. The Brotherhood isn\'t the Negro people; no\norganization is. All you see in Clifton\'s death is that it might harm the\nprestige of the Brotherhood. You see him only as a traitor. But Harlem\ndoesn\'t react that way."\n"Now he\'s lecturing us on the conditioned reflexes of the Negro\npeople," Tobitt said.\nI looked at him. I was very tired. "And what is the source of your\ngreat contributions to the movement, Brother? A career in burlesque? And of\nyour profound knowledge of Negroes? Are you from an old plantation-owning\nfamily? Does your black mammy shuffle nightly through your dreams?"\nHe opened his mouth and closed it like a fish. "I\'ll have you know\nthat I\'m married to a fine, intelligent Negro girl," he said.\nSo that\'s what makes you so cocky, I thought, seeing now how the\nlight struck him at an angle and made a wedge-shaped shadow beneath his\nnose. So that\'s it . . . and how did I guess there was a woman in it?\n"Brother, I apologize," I said. "I misjudged you. You have our\nnumber. In fact, you must be practically a Negro yourself. Was it by\nimmersion or injection?"\n"Now see here," he said, pushing back his chair.\nCome on, I thought, just make a move. Just another little move.\n"Brothers," Jack said, his eyes on me. "Let\'s stick to the discussion.\nI\'m intrigued. You were saying?"\nI watched Tobitt. He glared. I grinned.\n"I was saying that up here we know that the policemen didn\'t care\nabout Clifton\'s ideas. He was shot because he was black and because he\nresisted. Mainly because he was black."\nBrother Jack frowned. "You\'re riding \'race\' again. But how do they\nfeel about the dolls?"\n"I\'m riding the race I\'m forced to ride," I said. "And as for the dolls,\nthey know that as far as the cops were concerned Clifton could have been\nselling song sheets. Bibles, matzos. If he\'d been white, he\'d be alive. Or if\nhe\'d accepted being pushed around . . ."\n"Black and white, white and black," Tobitt said. "Must we listen to\nthis racist nonsense?"\n"You don\'t, Brother Negro," I said. "You get your own information\nstraight from the source. Is it a mulatto source, Brother? Don\'t answer -- the\nonly thing wrong is that your source is too narrow. You don\'t really think\nthat crowd turned out today because Clifton was a member of the\nBrotherhood?"\n"And why did they turn out?" Jack said, getting set as if to pounce\nforward.\n"Because we gave them the opportunity to express their feelings, to\naffirm themselves."\nBrother Jack rubbed his eye. "Do you know that you have become\nquite a theoretician?" he said. "You astound me."\n"I doubt that, Brother, but there\'s nothing like isolating a man to\nmake him think," I said.\n"Yes, that\'s true; some of our best ideas have been thought in prison.\nOnly you haven\'t been in prison, Brother, and you were not hired to think.\nHad you forgotten that? If so, listen to me: You were not hired to think." He\nwas speaking very deliberately and I thought, So . . . So here it is, naked\nand old and rotten. So now it\'s out in the open . . .\n"So now I know where I am," I said, "and with whom --"\n"Don\'t twist my meaning. For all of us, the committee does the\nthinking. For all of us. And you were hired to talk."\n"That\'s right, I was hired. Things have been so brotherly I had\nforgotten my place. But what if I wish to express an idea?"\n"We furnish all ideas. We have some acute ones. Ideas are part of\nour apparatus. Only the correct ideas for the correct occasion."\n"And suppose you misjudge the occasion?"\n"Should that ever happen, you keep quiet."\n"Even though I am correct?"\n"You say nothing unless it is passed by the committee. Otherwise I\nsuggest you keep saying the last thing you were told."\n"And when my people demand that I speak?"\n"The committee will have an answer!"\nI looked at him. The room was hot, quiet, smoky. The others looked\nat me strangely. I heard the nervous sound of someone mashing out a\ncigarette in a glass ash tray. I pushed back my chair, breathing deeply,\ncontrolled. I was on a dangerous road and I thought of Clifton and tried to\nget off of it. I said nothing.\nSuddenly Jack smiled and slipped back into his fatherly role.\n"Let us handle the theory and the business of strategy," he said. "We\nare experienced. We\'re graduates and while you are a smart beginner you\nskipped several grades. But they were important grades, especially for gaining\nstrategical knowledge. For such it is necessary to see the overall picture. More\nis involved than meets the eye. With the long view and the short view and\nthe overall view mastered, perhaps you won\'t slander the political\nconsciousness of the people of Harlem."\nCan\'t he see I\'m trying to tell them what\'s real, I thought. Does my\nmembership stop me from feeling Harlem?\n"All right," I said. "Have it your way, Brother; only the political\nconsciousness of Harlem is exactly a thing I know something about. That\'s\none class they wouldn\'t let me skip. I\'m describing a part of reality which I\nknow."\n"And that is the most questionable statement of all," Tobitt said.\n"I know," I said, running my thumb along the edge of the table,\n"your private source tells you differently. History\'s made at night, eh,\nBrother?"\n"I\'ve warned you," Tobitt said.\n"Brother to brother, Brother," I said, "try getting around more. You\nmight learn that today was the first time that they\'ve listened to our appeals\nin weeks. And I\'ll tell you something else: If we don\'t follow through on what\nwas done today, this might be the last . . ."\n"So, he\'s finally gotten around to predicting the future," Brother Jack\nsaid.\n"It\'s possible . . . though I hope not."\n"He\'s in touch with God," Tobitt said. "The black God."\nI looked at him and grinned. He had gray eyes and his irises were\nvery wide, the muscles ridged out on his jaws. I had his guard down and he\nwas swinging wild.\n"Not with God, nor with your wife, Brother," I told him. "I\'ve never\nmet either. But I\'ve worked among the people up here. Ask your wife to take\nyou around to the gin mills and the barber shops and the juke joints and the\nchurches, Brother. Yes, and the beauty parlors on Saturdays when they\'re\nfrying hair. A whole unrecorded history is spoken then, Brother. You wouldn\'t\nbelieve it but it\'s true. Tell her to take you to stand in the areaway of a\ncheap tenement at night and listen to what is said. Put her out on the\ncorner, let her tell you what\'s being put down. You\'ll learn that a lot of\npeople are angry because we failed to lead them in action. I\'ll stand on that\nas I stand on what I see and feel and on what I\'ve heard, and what I know."\n"No," Brother Jack said, getting to his feet, "you\'ll stand on the\ndecision of the committee. We\'ve had enough of this. The committee makes\nyour decisions and it is not its practice to give undue importance to the\nmistaken notions of the people. What\'s happened to your discipline?"\n"I\'m not arguing against discipline. I\'m trying to be useful. I\'m trying\nto point out a part of reality which the committee seems to have missed.\nWith just one demonstration we could --"\n"The committee has decided against such demonstrations," Brother\nJack said. "Such methods are no longer effective."\nSomething seemed to move out from under me, and out of the\ncorner of my eye I was suddenly aware of objects on the dark side of the\nhall. "But didn\'t anyone see what happened today?" I said. "What was that, a\ndream? What was ineffective about that crowd?"\n"Such crowds are only our raw materials, one of the raw materials to\nbe shaped to our program."\nI looked around the table and shook my head. "No wonder they\ninsult me and accuse us of betraying them . . ."\nThere was a sudden movement.\n"Repeat that," Brother Jack shouted, stepping forward.\n"It\'s true, I\'ll repeat it. Until this afternoon they\'ve been saying that\nthe Brotherhood betrayed them. I\'m telling you what\'s been said to me, and\nthat it why Brother Clifton disappeared."\n"That\'s an indefensible lie," Brother Jack said.\nAnd I looked at him slowly now, thinking, If this is it, this is it . . .\n"Don\'t call me that," I said softly. "Don\'t ever call me that, none of you. I\'ve\ntold you what I\'ve heard." My hand was in my pocket now, Brother Tarp\'s\nleg chain around my knuckles. I looked at each of them individually, trying to\nhold myself back and yet feeling it getting away from me. My head was\nwhirling as though I were riding a supersonic merry-go-round. Jack looked at\nme, a new interest behind his eyes, leaned forward.\n"So you\'ve heard it," he said. "Very well, so now hear this: We do\nnot shape our policies to the mistaken and infantile notions of the man in\nthe street. Our job is not to ask them what they think but to tell them!"\n"You\'ve said that," I said, "and that\'s one thing you can tell them\nyourself. Who are you, anyway, the great white father?"\n"Not their father, their leader. And .your leader. And don\'t forget it."\n"My leader sure, but what\'s your exact relationship to them?"\nHis red head bristled. "The leader. As leader of the Brotherhood, I\nam their leader."\n"But are you sure you aren\'t their great white father?" I said,\nwatching him closely, aware of the hot silence and feeling tension race from\nmy toes to my legs as I drew my feet quickly beneath me. "Wouldn\'t it be\nbetter if they called you Marse Jack?"\n"Now see here," he began, leaping to his feet to lean across the\ntable, and I spun my chair half around on its hind legs as he came between\nme and the light, gripping the edge of the table, spluttering and lapsing into\na foreign language, choking and coughing and shaking his head as I balanced\non my toes now, set to propel myself forward; seeing him above me and the\nothers behind him as suddenly something seemed to erupt out of his face.\nYou\'re seeing things, I thought, hearing it strike sharply against the table and\nroll as his arm shot out and snatched an object the size of a large marble\nand dropped it, plop! into his glass, and I could see the water shooting up in\na ragged, light-breaking pattern to spring in swift droplets across the oiled\ntable top. The room seemed to flatten. I shot to a high plateau above them\nand down, feeling the jolt on the end of my spine as the chair legs struck\nthe floor. The merry-go-round had speeded up, I heard his voice but no\nlonger listened. I stared at the glass, seeing how the light shone through,\nthrowing a transparent, precisely fluted shadow against the dark grain of the\ntable, and there on the bottom of the glass lay an eye. A glass eye. A\nbuttermilk white eye distorted by the light rays. An eye staring fixedly at me\nas from the dark waters of a well. Then I was looking at him standing above\nme, outlined by the light against the darkened half of the hall.\n". . . You must accept discipline. Either you accept decisions or you\nget out . . ."\nI stared into his face, feeling a sense of outrage. His left eye had\ncollapsed, a line of raw redness showing where the lid refused to close, and\nhis gaze had lost its command. I looked from his face to the glass, thinking,\nhe\'s disemboweled himself just in order to confound me . . . And the others\nhad known it all along. They aren\'t even surprised. I stared at the eye, aware\nof Jack pacing up and down, shouting.\n"Brother, are you following me?" He stopped, squinting at me with\nCyclopean irritation. "What is the matter?"\nI stared up at him, unable to answer.\nThen he understood and approached the table, smiling maliciously.\n"So that\'s it. So it makes you uncomfortable, does it? You\'re a sentimentalist,"\nhe said, sweeping up the glass and causing the eye to turn over in the water\nso that now it seemed to peer down at me from the ringed bottom of the\nglass. He smiled, holding the tumbler level with his empty socket, swirling the\nglass. "You didn\'t know about this?"\n"No, and I didn\'t want to know."\nSomeone laughed.\n"See, that demonstrates how long you\'ve been with us." He lowered\nthe glass. "I lost my eye in the line of duty. What do you think of that?" he\nsaid with a pride that made me all the angrier.\n"I don\'t give a damn how you lost it as long as you keep it hidden."\n"That is because you don\'t appreciate the meaning of sacrifice. I was\nordered to carry through an objective and I carried it through. Understand?\nEven though I had to lose my eye to do it . . ."\nHe was gloating now, holding up the eye in the glass as though it\nwere a medal of merit.\n"Not much like that traitor Clifton, is it?" Tobitt said.\nThe others were amused.\n"All right," I said. "All right! It was a heroic act. It saved the world,\nnow hide the bleeding wound!"\n"Don\'t overevaluate it," Jack said, quieter now. "The heroes are those\nwho die. This was nothing -- after it happened. A minor lesson in discipline.\nAnd do you know what discipline is, Brother Personal Responsibility? It\'s\nsacrifice, sacrifice, SACRIFICE!"\nHe slammed the glass upon the table, splashing the water on the\nback of my hand. I shook like a leaf. So that is the meaning of discipline, I\nthought, sacrifice . . . yes, and blindness; he doesn\'t see me. He doesn\'t even\nsee me. Am I about to strangle him? I do not know. He cannot possibly. I\nstill do not know. See! Discipline is sacrifice. Yes, and blindness. Yes. And me\nsitting here while he tries to intimidate me. That\'s it, with his goddam blind\nglass eye . . . Should you show him you get it? Shouldn\'t you? Shouldn\'t he\nknow it? Hurry! Shouldn\'t you? Look at it there, a good job, an almost\nperfect imitation that seemed alive . . . Should you, shouldn\'t you? Maybe he\ngot it where he learned that language he lapsed into. Shouldn\'t you? Make\nhim speak the unknown tongue, the language of the future. What\'s mattering\nwith you? Discipline. Is learning, didn\'t he say? Is it? I stand? You\'re sitting\nhere, ain\'t I? You\'re holding on, ain\'t I? He said you\'d learn so you\'re\nlearning, so he saw it all the time. He\'s a riddler, shouldn\'t we show him? So\nsit still is the way, and learn, never mind the eye, it\'s dead . . . All right\nnow, look at him, see him turning now, left, right, coming short-legged\ntoward you. See him, hep, hep! the one-eyed beacon. All right, all right . . .\nHep, hep! The short-legged deacon. All right! Nail him! The short-changing\ndialectical deacon . . . All right. There, so now you\'re learning . . . Get it\nunder control . . . Patience . . . Yes . . .\nI looked at him again as for the first time, seeing a little bantam\nrooster of a man with a high-domed forehead and a raw eye-socket that\nwouldn\'t quite accept its lid. I looked at him carefully now with some of the\nred spots fading and with the feeling that I was just awakening from a\ndream. I had boomeranged around.\n"I realize how you feel," he said, becoming an actor who\'d just\nfinished a part in a play and was speaking again in his natural voice. "I\nremember the first time I saw myself this way and it wasn\'t pleasant. And\ndon\'t think I wouldn\'t rather have my old one back." He felt in the water for\nhis eye now, and I could see its smooth half-spherical, half-amorphous form\nslip between his two fingers and spurt around the glass as though looking for\na way to break out. Then he had it, shaking off the water and breathing\nupon it as he walked across to the dark side of the room.\n"But who knows, Brothers," he said, with his back turned, "perhaps if\nwe do our work successfully the new society will provide me with a living\neye. Such a thing is not at all fantastic, although I\'ve been without mine for\nquite a while . . . What time is it, by the way?"\nBut what kind of society will make him see me, I thought, hearing\nTobitt answer, "Six-fifteen."\n"Then we\'d better leave immediately, we\'ve got a long way to travel,"\nhe said, coming across the floor. He had his eye in place now and he was\nsmiling. "How\'s that?" he asked me.\nI nodded, I was very tired. I simply nodded.\n"Good," he said. "I sincerely hope it never happens to you. Sincerely."\n"If it should, maybe you\'ll recommend me to your oculist," I said,\n"then I may not-see myself as others see-me-not."\nHe looked at me oddly then laughed. "See, Brothers, he\'s joking. He\nfeels brotherly again. But just the same, I hope you\'ll never need one of\nthese. Meanwhile go and see Hambro. He\'ll outline the program and give you\nthe instructions. As for today, just let things float. It is a development that is\nimportant only if we make it so. Otherwise it will be forgotten," he said,\ngetting into his jacket. "And you\'ll see that it\'s best. The Brotherhood must\nact as a co-ordinated unit."\nI looked at him. I was becoming aware of smells again and I needed\na bath. The others were standing now and moving toward the door. I stood\nup, feeling the shirt sticking to my back.\n"One last thing," Jack said, placing his hand on my shoulder and\nspeaking quietly. "Watch that temper, that\'s discipline, too. Learn to demolish\nyour brotherly opponents with ideas, with polemic skill. The other is for our\nenemies. Save it for them. And go get some rest."\nI was beginning to tremble. His face seemed to advance and recede,\nrecede and advance. He shook his head and smiled grimly.\n"I know how you feel," he said. "And it\'s too bad all that effort was\nfor nothing. But that in itself is a kind of discipline. I speak to you of what I\nhave learned and I\'m a great deal older than you. Good night."\nI looked at his eye. So he knows how I feel. Which eye is really the\nblind one? "Good night," I said.\n"Good night, Brother," they all except Tobitt said.\nIt\'ll be night, but it won\'t be good, I thought, calling a final "Good\nnight."\nThey left and I took my jacket and went and sat at my desk. I heard\nthem passing down the stairs and the closing of the door below. I felt as\nthough I\'d been watching a bad comedy. Only it was real and I was living it\nand it was the only historically meaningful life that I could live. If I left it,\nI\'d be nowhere. As dead and as meaningless as Clifton. I felt for the doll in\nthe shadow and dropped it on the desk. He was dead all right, and nothing\nwould come of his death now. He was useless even for a scavenger action.\nHe had waited too long, the directives had changed on him. He\'d barely\ngotten by with a funeral. And that was all. It was only a matter of a few\ndays, but he had missed and there was nothing I could do. But at least he\nwas dead and out of it.\nI sat there a while, growing wilder and fighting against it. I couldn\'t\nleave and I had to keep contact in order to fight. But I would never be the\nsame. Never. After tonight I wouldn\'t ever look the same, or feel the same.\nJust what I\'d be, I didn\'t know; I couldn\'t go back to what I was -- which\nwasn\'t much -- but I\'d lost too much to be what I was. Some of me, too,\nhad died with Tod Clifton. So I would see Hambro, for whatever it was\nworth. I got up and went out into the hall. The glass was still on the table\nand I swept it across the room, hearing it rumble and roll in the dark. Then\nI went downstairs.\nChapter 23\nThe bar downstairs was hot and crowded and there was a heated\nargument in progress over Clifton\'s shooting. I stood near the door and\nordered a bourbon. Then someone noticed me, and they tried to draw me in.\n"Please, not tonight," I said. "He was one of my best friends."\n"Oh, sure," they said, and I had another bourbon and left.\nWhen I reached 125th Street, I was approached by a group of\ncivil-liberties workers circulating a petition demanding the dismissal of the\nguilty policeman, and a block further on even the familiar woman street\npreacher was shouting a sermon about the slaughter of the innocents. A much\nbroader group was stirred up over the shooting than I had imagined. Good, I\nthought, perhaps it won\'t die down after all. Maybe I\'d better see Hambro\ntonight.\nLittle groups were all along the street, and I moved with increasing\nspeed until suddenly I had reached Seventh Avenue, and there beneath a\nstreet lamp with the largest crowd around him was Ras the Exhorter -- the\nlast man in the world I wanted to see. And I had just turned back when I\nsaw him lean down between his flags, shouting, "Look, look, Black ladies and\ngentlemahn! There goes the representative of the Brotherhood. Does Ras see\ncorrectly? Is that gentlemahn trying to pass us unnoticed? Ask him about it.\nWhat are you people waiting for, sir? What are you doing about our black\nyouth shot down beca\'se of your deceitful organization?"\nThey turned, looking at me, closing in. Some came up behind me\nand tried to push me further into the crowd. The Exhorter leaned down,\npointing at me, beneath the green traffic light.\n"Ask him what they are doing about it, ladies and gentlemahn. Are\nthey afraid -- or are the white folks and their black stooges sticking together\nto betray us?"\n"Get your hands off me," I shouted as someone reached around and\nseized my arm.\nI heard a voice cursing me softly.\n"Give the brother a chance to answer!" someone said.\nTheir faces pressed in upon me. I wanted to laugh, for suddenly I\nrealized that I didn\'t know whether I had been part of a sellout or not. But\nthey were in no mood for laughter.\n"Ladies and gentlemen, brothers and sisters," I said, "I disdain to\nanswer such an attack. Since you all know me and my work, I don\'t think it\'s\nnecessary. But it seems highly dishonorable to use the unfortunate death of\none of our most promising young men as an excuse for attacking an\norganization that has worked to bring an end to such outrages. Who was the\nfirst organization to act against this killing? The Brotherhood! Who was the\nfirst to arouse the people? The Brotherhood! Who will always be the first to\nadvance the cause of the people? Again the Brotherhood!\n"We acted and we shall always act, I assure you. But in our own\ndisciplined way. And we\'ll act positively. We refuse to waste our energies and\nyours in premature and ill-considered actions. We are Americans, all of us,\nwhether black or white, regardless of what the man on the ladder there tells\nyou, Americans. And we leave it to the gentleman up there to abuse the\nname of the dead. The Brotherhood grieves and feels deeply the loss of its\nbrother. And we are determined that his death shall be the beginning of\nprofound and lasting changes. It\'s easy enough to wait around for the minute\na man is safely buried and then stand on a ladder and smear the memory of\neverything he believed in. But to create something lasting of his death takes\ntime and careful planning --"\n"Gentlemahn," Ras shouted, "stick to the issue. You are not answering\nmy question. What are you doing about the shooting?"\nI moved toward the edge of the crowd. If this went any further, it\ncould be disastrous.\n"Stop abusing the dead for your own selfish ends," I said. "Let him\nrest in peace. Quit mangling his corpse!"\nI pushed away as he raged, hearing shouts of, "Tell him about it!"\n"Grave robber!"\nThe Exhorter waved his arms and pointed, shouting, "That mahn is a\npaid stooge of the white enslaver! Wheere has he been for the last few\nmonths when our black babies and women have been suffering --"\n"Let the dead rest in peace," I shouted, hearing someone call "Aw\nman, go back to Africa. Everybody knows the brother."\nGood, I thought, good. Then there was a scuffle behind me and I\nwhirled to see two men stop short. They were Ras\'s men.\n"Listen, mister," I said up to him, "if you know what\'s good for you,\nyou\'ll call off your goons. Two of them seem to want to follow me."\n"And that is a dahm lie!" he shouted.\n"There are witnesses if anything should happen to me. A man who\'ll\ndig up the dead hardly before he\'s buried will try anything, but I warn you\n--"\nThere were angry shouts from some of the crowd and I saw the men\ncontinue past me with hate in their eyes, leaving the crowd to disappear\naround the corner. Ras was attacking the Brotherhood now and others were\nanswering him from the audience, and I went on, moving back toward Lenox,\nmoving past a movie house when they grabbed me and started punching. But\nthis time they\'d picked the wrong spot, and the movie doorman intervened\nand they ran back toward Ras\'s street meeting. I thanked the doorman and\nwent on. I had been lucky; they hadn\'t hurt me, but Ras was becoming bold\nagain. On a less crowded street they might have done some damage.\nReaching the Avenue I stepped to the curb and signaled a cab, seeing\nit sail by. An ambulance went past, then another cab with its flag down. I\nlooked back. I felt that they were watching me from somewhere up the street\nbut I couldn\'t see them. Why didn\'t a taxi come! Then three men in natty\ncream-colored summer suits came to stand near me at the curb, and\nsomething about them struck me like a hammer. They were all wearing dark\nglasses. I had seen it thousands of times, but suddenly what I had considered\nan empty imitation of a Hollywood fad was flooded with personal significance.\nWhy not, I thought, why not, and shot across the street and into the\nair-conditioned chill of a drugstore.\nI saw them on a case strewn with sun visors, hair nets, rubber\ngloves, a card of false eyelashes, and seized the darkest lenses I could find.\nThey were of a green glass so dark that it appeared black, and I put them on\nimmediately, plunging into blackness and moving outside.\nI could barely see; it was almost dark now, and the streets swarmed\nin a green vagueness. I moved slowly across to stand near the subway and\nwait for my eyes to adjust. A strange wave of excitement boiled within me as\nI peered out at the sinister light. And now through the hot gusts from the\nunderground people were emerging and I could feel the trains vibrating the\nwalk. A cab rolled up to discharge a passenger and I was about to take it\nwhen the woman came up the stairs and stopped before me, smiling. Now\nwhat, I thought, seeing her standing there, smiling in her tight-fitting summer\ndress; a large young woman who reeked with Christmas Night perfume who\nnow came close.\n"Rinehart, baby, is that you?" she said.\nRinehart, I thought. So it works. She had her hand on my arm and\nfaster than I thought I heard myself answer, "Is that you, baby?" and waited\nwith tense breath.\n"Well, for once you\'re on time," she said. "But what you doing\nbareheaded, where\'s your new hat I bought you?"\nI wanted to laugh. The scent of Christmas Night was enfolding me\nnow and I saw her face draw closer, her eyes widening.\n"Say, you ain\'t Rinehart, man. What you trying to do? You don\'t even\ntalk like Rine. What\'s your story?"\nI laughed, backing away. "I guess we were both mistaken," I said.\nShe stepped backward clutching her bag, watching me, confused.\n"I really meant no harm," I said. "I\'m sorry. Who was it you mistook\nme for?"\n"Rinehart, and you\'d better not let him catch you pretending to be\nhim."\n"No," I said. "But you seemed so pleased to see him that I couldn\'t\nresist it. He\'s really a lucky man."\n"And I could have sworn you was -- Man, you git away from here\nbefore you get me in trouble," she said, moving aside, and I left.\nIt was very strange. But that about the hat was a good idea, I\nthought, hurrying along now and looking out for Ras\'s men. I was wasting\ntime. At the first hat shop I went in and bought the widest hat in stock and\nput it on. With this, I thought, I should be seen even in a snowstorm -- only\nthey\'d think I was someone else.\nThen I was back in the street and moving toward the subway. My\neyes adjusted quickly; the world took on a dark-green intensity, the lights of\ncars glowed like stars, faces were a mysterious blur; the garish signs of movie\nhouses muted down to a soft sinister glowing. I headed back for Ras\'s\nmeeting with a bold swagger. This was the real test, if it worked I would go\non to Hambro\'s without further trouble. In the angry period to come I would\nbe able to move about.\nA couple of men approached, eating up the walk with long jaunty\nstrides that caused their heavy silk sport shirts to flounce rhythmically upon\ntheir bodies. They too wore dark glasses, their hats were set high upon their\nheads, the brims turned down. A couple of hipsters, I thought, just as they\nspoke.\n"What you sayin\', daddy-o," they said.\n"Rinehart, poppa, tell us what you putting down," they said.\nOh, hell, they\'re probably his friends, I thought, waving and moving\non.\n"We know what you\'re doing, Rinehart," one of them called. "Play it\ncool, ole man, play it cool!"\nI waved again as though in on the joke. They laughed behind me. I\nwas nearing the end of the block now, wet with sweat. Who was this\nRinehart and what was he putting down? I\'d have to learn more about him\nto avoid further misidentifications . . .\nA car passed with its radio blaring. Ahead I could hear the Exhorter\nbarking harshly to the crowd. Then I was moving close, and coming to a stop\nconspicuously in the space left for pedestrians to pass through the crowd. To\nthe rear they were lined up two deep before the store windows. Before me\nthe listeners merged in a green-tinted gloom. The Exhorter gestured violently,\nblasting the Brotherhood.\n"The time for ahction is here. We mahst chase them out of Harlem,"\nhe cried. And for a second I thought he had caught me in the sweep of his\neyes, and tensed.\n"Ras said chase them! It is time Ras the Exhorter become Ras the\nDESTROYER!"\nShouts of agreement arose and I looked behind me, seeing the men\nwho had followed me and thinking, What did he mean, destroyer?\n"I repeat, black ladies and gentlemahn, the time has come for\nahction! I, Ras the Destroyer, repeat, the time has come!"\nI trembled with excitement; they hadn\'t recognized me. It works, I\nthought. They see the hat, not me. There is a magic in it. It hides me right\nin front of their eyes . . . But suddenly I wasn\'t sure. With Ras calling for\nthe destruction of everything white in Harlem, who could notice me? I needed\na better test. If I was to carry out my plan . . . What plan? Hell, I don\'t\nknow, come on . . .\nI weaved out of the crowd and left, heading for Hambro\'s.\nA group of zoot-suiters greeted me in passing. "Hey now, daddy-o,"\nthey called. "Hey now!"\n"Hey now!" I said.\nIt was as though by dressing and walking in a certain way I had\nenlisted in a fraternity in which I was recognized at a glance -- not by\nfeatures, but by clothes, by uniform, by gait. But this gave rise to another\nuncertainty. I was not a zoot-suiter, but a kind of politician. Or was I? What\nwould happen in a real test? What about the fellows who\'d been so insulting\nat the Jolly Dollar? I was halfway across Eighth Avenue at the thought and\nretraced my steps, running for an uptown bus.\nThere were many of the regular customers draped around the bar.\nThe room was crowded and Barrelhouse was on duty. I could feel the frame\nof the glasses cutting into the ridge of my nose as I tilted my hat and\nsqueezed up to the bar. Barrelhouse looked at me roughly, his lips pushed\nout.\n"What brand you drinking tonight, Poppa-stopper?" he said.\n"Make it Ballantine\'s," I said in my natural voice.\nI watched his eyes as he set the beer before me and slapped the bar\nwith his enormous hand for his money. Then, my heart beating faster, I\nmade my old gesture of payment, spinning the coin upon the bar and waited.\nThe coin disappeared into his fist.\n"Thanks, pops," he said, moving on and leaving me puzzled. For\nthere had been recognition of a kind in his voice but not for me. He never\ncalled me "pops" or "poppa-stopper." It\'s working, I thought, perhaps it\'s\nworking very well.\nCertainly something was working on me, and profoundly. Still I was\nrelieved. It was hot. Perhaps that was it. I drank the cold beer, looking back\nto the rear of the room to the booths. A crowd of men and women moiled\nlike nightmare figures in the smoke-green haze. The juke box was dinning\nand it was like looking into the depths of a murky cave. And now someone\nmoved aside and looking down along the curve of the bar past the bobbing\nheads and shoulders I saw the juke box, lit up like a bad dream of the Fiery\nFurnace, shouting:\nJelly, Jelly\nJelly,\nAll night long.\nAnd yet, I thought, watching a numbers runner paying off a bet, this\nis one place that the Brotherhood definitely penetrated. Let Hambro explain\nthat, too, along with all the rest he\'d have to explain.\nI drained the glass and turned to leave, when there across at the\nlunch counter I saw Brother Maceo. I moved impulsively, forgetting my\ndisguise until almost upon him, then checked myself and put my disguise\nonce more to a test. Reaching roughly across his shoulder I picked up a\ngreasy menu that rested between the sugar shaker and the hot-sauce bottle\nand pretended to read it through my dark lenses.\n"How\'re the ribs, pops?" I said.\n"Fine, least these here I\'m eatin\' is."\n"Yeah? How much you know about ribs?"\nHe raised his head slowly, looking across at the spitted chickens\nrevolving before the low blue rotisserie flames. "I reckon I know as much\nabout \'em as you," he said, "and probably more, since I probably been eatin\'\n\'em a few years longer than you, and in a few more places. What makes you\nthink you kin come in here messing with me anyhow?"\nHe turned, looking straight into my face now, challenging me. He\nwas very game and I wanted to laugh.\n"Oh, take it easy," I growled. "A man can ask a question, can\'t he?"\n"You got your answer," he said, turning completely around on the\nstool. "So now I guess you ready to pull your knife."\n"Knife?" I said, wanting to laugh. "Who said anything about a knife?"\n"That\'s what you thinking about. Somebody say something you don\'t\nlike and you kinda fellows pull your switch blades. So all right, go ahead and\npull it. I\'m as ready to die as I\'m gon\' ever be. Let\'s see you, go ahead!"\nHe reached for the sugar shaker now, and I stood there feeling\nsuddenly that the old man before me was not Brother Maceo at all, but\nsomeone else disguised to confuse me. The glasses were working too well.\nHe\'s a game old brother, I thought, but this\'ll never do.\nI pointed toward his plate. "I asked you about the ribs," I said, "not\nyour ribs. Who said anything about a knife?"\n"Never mind that, just go on and pull it," he said.\n"Let\'s see you. Or is you waiting for me to turn my back. All right,\nhere it is, here\'s my back," he said, turning swiftly on the stool and around\nagain, his arm set to throw the shaker.\nCustomers were turning to look, were moving clear.\n"What\'s the matter, Maceo?" someone said.\n"Nothing I caint handle; this confidencing sonofabitch come in here\nbluffing --"\n"You take it easy, old man," I said. "Don\'t let your mouth get your\nhead in trouble," thinking, Why am I talking like this?\n"You don\'t have to worry about that, sonofabitch, pull your switch\nblade!"\n"Give it to him, Maceo, coolcrack the motherfouler!"\nI marked the position of the voice by ear now, turning so that I\ncould see Maceo, the agitator, and the customers blocking the door. Even the\njuke box had stopped and I could feel the danger mounting so swiftly that I\nmoved without thinking, bounding over quickly and sweeping up a beer\nbottle, my body trembling.\n"All right," I said, "if that\'s the way you want it, all right! The next\none who talks out of turn gets this!"\nMaceo moved and I feinted with the bottle, seeing him dodge, his\narm set to throw and held only because I was crowding him; a dark old man\nin overalls and a gray long-billed cloth cap, who looked dreamlike through\nthe green glasses.\n"Throw it," I said. "Go on," overcome with the madness of the thing.\nHere I\'d set out to test a disguise on a friend and now I was ready to beat\nhim to his knees -- not because I wanted to but because of place and\ncircumstance. Okay, okay, it was absurd and yet real and dangerous and if he\nmoved, I\'d let him have it as brutally as possible. To protect myself I\'d have\nto, or the drunks would gang me. Maceo was set, looking at me coldly, and\nsuddenly I heard a voice boom out, "Ain\'t going to be no fighting in my\njoint!" It was Barrelhouse. "Put them things down y\'all, they cost money."\n"Hell, Barrelhouse, let \'em fight!"\n"They can fight in the streets, not in here -- Hey, y\'all," he called\n"look over here . . ."\nI saw him now, leaning forward with a pistol in his huge fist, resting\nit steady upon the bar.\n"Now put \'em down y\'all," he said mournfully. "I done ask you to\nput my property down."\nBrother Maceo looked from me to Barrelhouse.\n"Put it down, old man," I said, thinking, Why am I acting from pride\nwhen this is not really me?\n"You put yourn down," he said.\n"Both of y\'all put \'em down; and you, Rinehart," Barrelhouse said,\ngesturing at me with his pistol, "you get out of my joint and stay out. We\ndon\'t need your money in here."\nI started to protest, but he held up his palm.\n"Now you all right with me, Rinehart, don\'t get me wrong. But I just\ncan\'t stand trouble," Barrelhouse said.\nBrother Maceo had replaced the shaker now and I put my bottle\ndown and backed to the door.\n"And Rine," Barrelhouse said, "don\'t go try to pull no pistol neither,\n\'cause this here one is loaded and I got a permit."\nI backed to the door, my scalp prickling, watching them both.\n"Next time don\'t ask no questions you don\'t want answered," Maceo\ncalled. "An\' if you ever want to finish this argument I be right here."\nI felt the outside air explode around me and I stood just beyond the\ndoor laughing with the sudden relief of the joke restored, looking back at the\ndefiant old man in his long-billed cap and the confounded eyes of the crowd.\nRinehart, Rinehart, I thought, what kind of man is Rinehart?\nI was still chuckling when, in the next block, I waited for the traffic\nlights near a group of men who stood on the corner passing a bottle of\ncheap wine between them as they discussed Clifton\'s murder.\n"What we need is some guns," one of them said. "An eye for an\neye."\n"Hell yes, machine guns. Pass me the sneakypete, Muckleroy."\n"Wasn\'t for that Sullivan Law this here New York wouldn\'t be\nnothing but a shooting gallery," another man said.\n"Here\'s the sneakypete, and don\'t try to find no home in that bottle."\n"It\'s the only home I got, Muckleroy. You want to take that away\nfrom me?"\n"Man, drink up and pass the damn bottle."\nI started around them, hearing one of them say, "What you saying,\nMr. Rinehart, how\'s your hammer hanging?"\nEven up here, I thought, beginning to hurry. "Heavy, man," I said,\nknowing the answer to that one, "very heavy." They laughed.\n"Well, it\'ll be lighter by morning."\n"Say, look ahere, Mr. Rinehart, how about giving me a job?" one of\nthem said, approaching me, and I waved and crossed the street, walking\nrapidly down Eighth toward the next bus stop.\nThe shops and groceries were dark now, and children were running\nand yelling along the walks, dodging in and out among the adults. I walked,\nstruck by the merging fluidity of forms seen through the lenses. Could this be\nthe way the world appeared to Rinehart? All the dark-glass boys? "For now\nwe see as through a glass darkly but then -- but then --" I couldn\'t\nremember the rest.\nShe was carrying a shopping bag and moved gingerly on her feet.\nUntil she touched my arm I thought that she was talking to herself.\n"I say, pardon me, son, look like you trying to pass on by me\ntonight. What\'s the final figger?"\n"Figure? What figure?"\n"Now you know what I mean," she said, her voice rising as she put\nher hands on her hips and looked forward. "I mean today\'s last number. Ain\'t\nyou Rine the runner?"\n"Rine the runner?"\n"Yas, Rinehart the number man. Who you trying to fool?"\n"But that\'s not my name, madame," I said, speaking as precisely as I\ncould and stepping away from her. "You\'ve made a mistake."\nHer mouth fell wide. "You ain\'t? Well, why you look so much like\nhim?" she said with hot doubt in her voice. "Now, ain\'t this here something.\nLet me get on home; if my dream come out, I\'m-a have to go look that\nrascal up. And here I needs that money too."\n"I hope you won," I said, straining to see her clearly, "and I hope he\npays off."\n"Thanks, son, but he\'ll pay off all right. I can see you ain\'t Rinehart\nnow though. I\'m sorry for stopping you."\n"It\'s all right," I said.\n"If I\'d looked at your shoes I woulda known --"\n"Why?"\n" \'Cause Rine the runner is known for them knobtoed kind."\nI watched her limp away, rocking like the Old Ship of Zion. No\nwonder everyone knows him, I thought, in that racket you have to get\naround. I was aware of my black-and-white shoes for the first time since the\nday of Clifton\'s shooting.\nWhen the squad car veered close to the curb and rolled along slowly\nbeside me I knew what was coming before the cop opened his mouth.\n"That you, Rinehart, my man?" the cop who was not driving said. He\nwas white. I could see the shield gleaming on his cap but the number was\nvague.\n"Not this time, officer," I said.\n"The hell you say; what\'re you trying to pull? Is this a holdout?"\n"You\'re making a mistake," I said. "I\'m not Rinehart."\nThe car stopped, a flashlight beamed in my green-lensed eyes. He\nspat into the street. "Well, you better be by morning," he said, "and you\nbetter have our cut in the regular place. Who the hell you think you are?" he\ncalled as the car speeded up and away.\nAnd before I could turn a crowd of men ran up from the corner\npool hall. One of them carried an automatic in his hand.\n"What were those sonsabitches trying to do to you, daddy?" he said.\n"It was nothing, they thought I was someone else."\n"Who\'d they take you for?"\nI looked at them -- were they criminals or simply men who were\nworked up over the shooting?\n"Some guy named Rinehart," I said.\n"Rinehart -- Hey, y\'all hear that?" snorted the fellow with the gun.\n"Rinehart! Them paddies must be going stone blind. Anybody can see you\nain\'t Rinehart."\n"But he do look like Rine," another man said, staring at me with his\nhands in his trousers pockets.\n"Like hell he does."\n"Hell, man, Rinehart would be driving that Cadillac this time of\nnight. What the hell you talking about?"\n"Listen, Jack," the fellow with the gun said, "don\'t let nobody make\nyou act like Rinehart. You got to have a smooth tongue, a heartless heart and\nbe ready to do anything. But if them paddies bother you agin, just let us\nknow. We aim to stop some of this head-whupping they been doing."\n"Sure," I said.\n"Rinehart," he said again. "Ain\'t that a bitch?"\nThey turned and went arguing back to the pool hall and I hurried\nout of the neighborhood. Having forgotten Hambro for the moment I walked\neast instead of west. I wanted to remove the glasses but decided against it.\nRas\'s men might still be on the prowl.\nIt was quieter now. No one paid me any special attention, although\nthe street was alive with pedestrians, all moiling along in the mysterious tint\nof green. Perhaps I\'m out of his territory at last, I thought and began trying\nto place Rinehart in the scheme of things. He\'s been around all the while,\nbut I have been looking in another direction. He was around and others like\nhim, but I had looked past him until Clifton\'s death (or was it Ras?) had\nmade me aware. What on earth was hiding behind the face of things? If dark\nglasses and a white hat could blot out my identity so quickly, who actually\nwas who?\nThe perfume was exotic and seemed to roll up the walk behind me\nas I became aware of a woman strolling casually behind me.\n"I\'ve been waiting for you to recognize me, daddy," a voice said. "I\'ve\nbeen waiting for you a long time."\nIt was a pleasant voice with a slightly husky edge and plenty of sleep\nin it.\n"Don\'t you hear me, daddy?" she said. And I started to look around,\nhearing, "No, daddy, don\'t look back; my old man might be cold trailing me.\nJust walk along beside me while I tell you where to meet me. I swear I\nthought you\'d never come. Will you be able to see me tonight?"\nShe had moved close to me now and suddenly I felt a hand fumbling\nat my jacket pocket.\n"All right, daddy, you don\'t have to jump evil on me, here it is; now\nwill you see me?"\nI stopped dead, grabbing her hand and looking at her, an exotic girl\neven through the green glasses, looking at me with a smile that suddenly\nbroke. "Rinehart, daddy, what\'s the matter?"\nSo here it goes again, I thought, holding her tightly.\n"I\'m not Rinehart, Miss," I said. "And for the first time tonight I\'m\ntruly sorry."\n"But Bliss, daddy -- Rinehart! You\'re not trying to put your baby\ndown -- Daddy, what did I do?"\nShe seized my arm and we were poised face to face in the middle of\nthe walk. And suddenly she screamed, "Oooooooh! You really aren\'t! And me\ntrying to give you his money. Get away from me, you dumb John. Get away\nfrom me!"\nI backed off. Her face was distorted as she stamped her high heels\nand screamed. Behind me I heard someone say, "Hey, what was that?"\nfollowed by the sound of running feet as I shot off and around the corner\naway from her screams. That lovely girl, I thought, that lovely girl.\nSeveral blocks away I stopped, out of breath. And both pleased and\nangry. How stupid could people be? Was everyone suddenly nuts? I looked\nabout me. It was a bright street, the walks full of people. I stood at the curb\ntrying to breathe. Up the street a sign with a cross glowed above the walk:\nHOLY WAY STATION\nBEHOLD THE LIVING GOD\nThe letters glowed dark green and I wondered if it were from the lenses or\nthe actual color of the neon tubes. A couple of drunks stumbled past. I\nheaded for Hambro\'s, passing a man sitting on the curb with his head bent\nover his knees. Cars passed. I went on. Two solemn-faced children came\npassing out handbills which first I refused, then went back and took. After\nall, I had to know what was going on in the community. I took the bill and\nstepped close to the street light, reading.\nBehold the Invisible\nThy will be done O Lord!\nI See all, Know all. Tell all, Cure all.\nYou shall see the unknown wonders.\n-- REV. B. P. RINEHART,\nSpiritual Technologist.\nThe old is ever new\nWay Stations in New Orleans, the home of mystery,\nBirmingham, New York, Chicago, Detroit and L. A.\nNo Problem too Hard for God.\nCome to the Way Station.\nBEHOLD THE INVISIBLE!\nAttend our services, prayer meetings Thrice weekly\nJoin us in the NEW REVELATION of the OLD TIME RELIGION!\nBEHOLD THE SEEN UNSEEN\nBEHOLD THE INVISIBLE\nYE WHO ARE WEARY COME HOME!\nI DO WHAT YOU WANT DONE! DON\'T WAIT!\nI dropped the leaflet into the gutter and moved on. I walked slowly,\nmy breath still coming hard. Could it be? Soon I reached the sign. It hung\nabove a store that had been converted into a church, and I stepped into the\nshallow lobby and wiped my face with a handkerchief. Behind me I heard the\nrise and fall of an old-fashioned prayer such as I hadn\'t heard since leaving\nthe campus; and then only when visiting country preachers were asked to\npray. The voice rose and fell in a rhythmical, dreamlike recital-part\nenumeration of earthly trials undergone by the congregation, part rapt display\nof vocal virtuosity, part appeal to God. I was still wiping my face and\nsquinting at crude Biblical scenes painted on the windows when two old\nladies came up to me.\n"Even\', Rever\'n Rinehart," one of them said. "How\'s our dear pastor\nthis warm evening?"\nOh, no, I thought, but perhaps agreeing will cause less trouble than\ndenying, and I said, "Good evening, sisters," muffling my voice with my\nhandkerchief and catching the odor of the girl\'s perfume from my hand.\n"This here\'s Sister Harris, Rever\'n. She come to join our little band."\n"God bless you, Sister Harris," I said, taking her extended hand.\n"You know, Rever\'n, I once heard you preach years ago. You was just\na lil\' ole twelve-year-old boy, back in Virginia. And here I come North and\nfind you, praise God, still preaching the gospel, doing the Lord\'s work. Still\npreaching the ole time religion here in this wicked city --"\n"Er, Sister Harris," the other sister said, "we better get on in and\nfind our seats. Besides, the pastor\'s kind of got things to do. Though you are\nhere a little early, aren\'t you, Rever\'n?"\n"Yes," I said, dabbing my mouth with my handkerchief. They were\nmotherly old women of the southern type and I suddenly felt a nameless\ndespair. I wanted to tell them that Rinehart was a fraud, but now there came\na shout from inside the church and I heard a burst of music.\n"Just lissen to it, Sister Harris. That\'s the new kind of guitar music I\ntold you Rever\'n Rinehart got for us. Ain\'t it heavenly?"\n"Praise God," Sister Harris said. "Praise God!"\n"Excuse us, Rever\'n, I have to see Sister Judkins about the money\nshe collected for the building fund. And, Rever\'n, last night I sold ten\nrecordings of your inspiring sermon. Even sold one to the white lady I work\nfor."\n"Bless you," I found myself saying in a voice heavy with despair,\n"bless you, bless you."\nThen the door opened and I looked past their heads into a small\ncrowded room of men and women sitting in folding chairs, to the front where\na slender woman in a rusty black robe played passionate boogie-woogie on an\nupright piano along with a young man wearing a skull cap who struck\nrighteous riffs from an electric guitar which was connected to an amplifier\nthat hung from the ceiling above a gleaming white and gold pulpit. A man in\nan elegant red cardinal\'s robe and a high lace collar stood resting against an\nenormous Bible and now began to lead a hard-driving hymn which the\ncongregation shouted in the unknown tongue. And back and high on the wall\nabove him there arched the words in letters of gold:\nLET THERE BE LIGHT!\nThe whole scene quivered vague and mysterious in the green light,\nthen the door closed and the sound muted down.\nIt was too much for me. I removed my glasses and tucked the white\nhat carefully beneath my arm and walked away. Can it be, I thought, can it\nactually be? And I knew that it was. I had heard of it before but I\'d never\ncome so close. Still, could he be all of them: Rine the runner and Rine the\ngambler and Rine the briber and Rine the lover and Rinehart the Reverend?\nCould he himself be both rind and heart? What is real anyway? But how\ncould I doubt it? He was a broad man, a man of parts who got around.\nRinehart the rounder. It was true as I was true. His world was possibility\nand he knew it. He was years ahead of me and I was a fool. I must have\nbeen crazy and blind. The world in which we lived was without boundaries. A\nvast seething, hot world of fluidity, and Rine the rascal was at home. Perhaps\nonly Rine the rascal was at home in it. It was unbelievable, but perhaps only\nthe unbelievable could be believed. Perhaps the truth was always a lie.\nPerhaps, I thought, the whole thing should roll off me like drops of\nwater rolling off Jack\'s glass eye. I should search out the proper political\nclassification, label Rinehart and his situation and quickly forget it. I hurried\naway from the church so swiftly that I found myself back at the office before\nI remembered that I was going to Hambro\'s.\nI was both depressed and fascinated. I wanted to know Rinehart and\nyet, I thought, I\'m upset because I know I don\'t have to know him, that\nsimply becoming aware of his existence, being mistaken for him, is enough to\nconvince me that Rinehart is real. It couldn\'t be, but it is. And it can be, is,\nsimply because it\'s unknown. Jack wouldn\'t dream of such a possibility, nor\nTobitt, who thinks he\'s so close. Too little was known, too much was in the\ndark. I thought of Clifton and of Jack himself; how much was really known\nabout either of them? How much was known about me? Who from my old\nlife had challenged me? And after all this time I had just discovered Jack\'s\nmissing eye.\nMy entire body started to itch, as though I had just been removed\nfrom a plaster cast and was unused to the new freedom of movement. In the\nSouth everyone knew you, but coming North was a jump into the unknown.\nHow many days could you walk the streets of the big city without\nencountering anyone who knew you, and how many nights? You could\nactually make yourself anew. The notion was frightening, for now the world\nseemed to flow before my eyes. All boundaries down, freedom was not only\nthe recognition of necessity, it was the recognition of possibility. And sitting\nthere trembling I caught a brief glimpse of the possibilities posed by\nRinehart\'s multiple personalities and turned away. It was too vast and\nconfusing to contemplate. Then I looked at the polished lenses of the glasses\nand laughed. I had been trying simply to turn them into a disguise but they\nhad become a political instrument instead; for if Rinehart could use them in\nhis work, no doubt I could use them in mine. It was too simple, and yet\nthey had already opened up a new section of reality for me. What would the\ncommittee say about that? What did their theory tell them of such a world? I\nrecalled a report of a shoeshine boy who had encountered the best treatment\nin the South simply by wearing a white turban instead of his usual Dobbs or\nStetson, and I fell into a fit of laughing. Jack would be outraged at the very\nsuggestion of such a state of things. And yet there was truth in it; this was\nthe real chaos which he thought he was describing -- so long ago it seemed\nnow . . . Outside the Brotherhood we were outside history; but inside of it\nthey didn\'t see us. It was a hell of a state of affairs, we were nowhere. I\nwanted to back away from it, but still I wanted to discuss it, to consult\nsomeone who\'d tell me it was only a brief, emotional illusion. I wanted the\nprops put back beneath the world. So now I had a real need to see Hambro.\nGetting up to go, I looked at the wall map and laughed at Columbus.\nWhat an India he\'d found! I was almost across the hall when I remembered\nand came back and put on the hat and glasses. I\'d need them to carry me\nthrough the streets.\nI took a cab. Hambro lived in the West Eighties, and once in the\nvestibule I tucked the hat under my arm and put the glasses in my pocket\nalong with Brother Tarp\'s leg chain and Clifton\'s doll. My pocket was getting\noverloaded.\nI was shown into a small, book-lined study by Hambro himself. From\nanother part of the apartment came a child\'s voice singing Humpty Dumpty,\nawakening humiliating memories of my first Easter program during which I\nhad stood before the church audience and forgotten the words . . .\n"My kid," Hambro said, "filibustering against going to bed. A real sea\nlawyer, that kid."\nThe child was singing Hickory Dickory Dock, very fast, as Hambro\nshut the door. He was saying something about the child and I looked at him\nwith sudden irritation. With Rinehart on my mind, why had I come here?\nHambro was so tall that when he crossed his legs both feet touched\nthe floor. He had been my teacher during my period of indoctrination and\nnow I realized that I shouldn\'t have come. Hambro\'s lawyer\'s mind was too\nnarrowly logical. He\'d see Rinehart simply as a criminal, my obsession as a\nfall into pure mysticism . . . You\'d better hope that is the way he\'ll see it, I\nthought. Then I decided to ask him about conditions uptown and leave . . .\n"Look, Brother Hambro," I said, "what\'s to be done about my\ndistrict?"\nHe looked at me with a dry smile. "Have I become one of those\nbores who talk too much about their children?"\n"Oh, no, it\'s not that," I said. "I\'ve had a hard day. I\'m nervous.\nWith Clifton\'s death and things in the district so bad, I guess . . ."\n"Of course," he said, still smiling, "but why are you worried about\nthe district?"\n"Because things are getting out of hand. Ras\'s men tried to rough me\nup tonight and our strength is steadily going to hell."\n"That\'s regrettable," he said, "but there\'s nothing to be done about it\nthat wouldn\'t upset the larger plan. It\'s unfortunate, Brother, but your\nmembers will have to be sacrificed."\nThe distant child had stopped singing now, and it was dead quiet. I\nlooked at the angular composure ot his face searching for the sincerity in his\nwords. I could feel some deep change. It was as though my discovery of\nRinehart had opened a gulf between us over which, though we sat within\ntouching distance, our voices barely carried and then fell flat, without an\necho. I tried to shake it away, but still the distance, so great that neither\ncould grasp the emotional tone of the other, remained.\n"Sacrifice?" my voice said. "You say that very easily."\n"Just the same, though, all who leave must be considered expendable.\nThe new directives must be followed rigidly."\nIt sounded unreal, an antiphonal game. "But why?" I said. "Why\nmust the directives be changed in my district when the old methods are\nneeded -- especially now?" Somehow I couldn\'t get the needed urgency into\nmy words, and beneath it all something about Rinehart bothered me, darted\njust beneath the surface of my mind; something that had to do with me\nintimately.\n"It\'s simple, Brother," Hambro was saying. "We are making temporary\nalliances with other political groups and the interests of one group of brothers\nmust be sacrificed to that ot the whole."\n"Why wasn\'t I told of this?" I said.\n"You will be, in time, by the committee -- Sacrifice is necessary now\n--"\n"But shouldn\'t sacrifice be made willingly by those who know what\nthey are doing? My people don\'t understand why they\'re being sacrificed.\nThey don\'t even know they\'re being sacrificed -- at least not by us . . ." But\nwhat, my mind went on, if they\'re as willing to be duped by the Brotherhood\nas by Rinehart?\nI sat up at the thought and there must have been an odd expression\non my face, for Hambro, who was resting his elbows upon the arms of his\nchair and touching his fingertips together, raised his eyebrows as though\nexpecting me to continue. Then he said, "The disciplined members will\nunderstand."\nI pulled Tarp\'s leg chain from my pocket and slipped it over my\nknuckles. He didn\'t notice. "Don\'t you realize that we have only a handful of\ndisciplined members left? Today the funeral brought out hundreds who\'ll drop\naway as soon as they see we\'re not following through. And now we\'re being\nattacked on the streets. Can\'t you understand? Other groups are circulating\npetitions, Ras is calling for violence. The committee is mistaken if they think\nthis is going to die down."\nHe shrugged. "It\'s a risk which we must take. All of us must sacrifice\nfor the good of the whole. Change is achieved through sacrifice. We follow\nthe laws of reality, so we make sacrifices."\n"But the community is demanding equality of sacrifice," I said.\n"We\'ve never asked for special treatment."\n"It isn\'t that simple, Brother," he said. "We have to protect our gains.\nIt\'s inevitable that some must make greater sacrifices than others . . ."\n"That \'some\' being my people . . ."\n"In this instance, yes."\n"So the weak must sacrifice for the strong? Is that it, Brother?"\n"No, a part of the whole is sacrificed -- and will continue to be until\na new society is formed."\n"I don\'t get it," I said. "I just don\'t get it. We work our hearts out\ntrying to get the people to follow us and just when they do, just when they\nsee their relationship to events, we drop them. I don\'t see it."\nHambro smiled remotely. "We don\'t have to worry about the\naggressiveness of the Negroes. Not during the new period or any other. In\nfact, we now have to slow them down for their own good. It\'s a scientific\nnecessity."\nI looked at him, at the long, bony, almost Lincolnesque face. I might\nhave liked him, I thought, he seems to be a really kind and sincere man and\nyet he can say this to me . . .\n"So you really believe that," I said quietly.\n"With all my integrity," he said.\nFor a second I thought I\'d laugh. Or let fly with Tarp\'s link.\nIntegrity! He talks to me of integrity! I described a circle in the air. I\'d tried\nto build my integrity upon the role of Brotherhood and now it had changed\nto water, air. What was integrity? What did it have to do with a world in\nwhich Rinehart was possible and successful?\n"But what\'s changed?" I said. "Wasn\'t I brought in to arouse their\naggressiveness?" My voice fell sad, hopeless.\n"For that particular period," Hambro said, leaning a little forward.\n"Only for that period."\n"And what will happen now?" I said.\nHe blew a smoke ring, the blue-gray circle rising up boiling within\nits own jetting form, hovering for an instant then disintegrating into a\nweaving strand.\n"Cheer up!" he said. "We shall progress. Only now they must be\nbrought along more slowly . . ."\nHow would he look through the green lenses? I thought, saying, "Are\nyou sure you\'re not saying that they must be held back?"\nHe chuckled. "Now, listen," he said. "Don\'t stretch me on a rack of\ndialectic. I\'m a brother."\n"You mean the brakes must be put on the old wheel of history," I\nsaid. "Or is it the little wheels within the wheel?"\nHis face sobered. "I mean only that they must be brought along\nmore slowly. They can\'t be allowed to upset the tempo of the master plan.\nTiming is all important. Besides, you still have a job to do, only now it will\nbe more educational."\n"And what about the shooting?"\n"Those who are dissatisfied will drop away and those who remain\nyou\'ll teach . . ."\n"I don\'t think I can," I said.\n"Why? It\'s just as important."\n"Because they are against us; besides, I\'d feel like Rinehart . . ." It\nslipped out and he looked at me.\n"Like who?"\n"Like a charlatan," I said.\nHambro laughed. "I thought you had learned about that, Brother."\nI looted at him quickly. "Learned what?"\n"That it\'s impossible not to take advantage of the people."\n"That\'s Rinehartism -- cynicism . . ."\n"What?"\n"Cynicism," I said.\n"Not cynicism -- realism. The trick is to take advantage of them in\ntheir own best interest."\nI sat forward in my chair, suddenly conscious of the unreality of the\nconversation. "But who is to judge? Jack? The committee?"\n"We judge through cultivating scientific objectivity," he said with a\nvoice that had a smile in it, and suddenly I saw the hospital machine, felt as\nthough locked in again.\n"Don\'t kid yourself," I said. "The only scientific objectivity is a\nmachine."\n"Discipline, not machinery," he said. "We\'re scientists. We must take\nthe risks of our science and our will to achieve. Would you like to resurrect\nGod to take responsibility?" He shook his head. "No, Brother, we have to\nmake such decisions ourselves. Even if we must sometimes appear as\ncharlatans."\n"You\'re in for some surprises," I said.\n"Maybe so and maybe not," he said. "At any rate, through our very\nposition in the vanguard we must do and say the things necessary to get the\ngreatest number of the people to move toward what is for their own good."\nSuddenly I couldn\'t stand it.\n"Look at me! Look at me!" I said. "Everywhere I\'ve turned somebody\nhas wanted to sacrifice me for my good -- only they were the ones who\nbenefited. And now we start on the old sacrificial merry-go-round. At what\npoint do we stop? Is this the new true definition, is Brotherhood a matter of\nsacrificing the weak? If so, at what point do we stop?"\nHambro looked as though I were not there. "At the proper moment\nscience will stop us. And of course we as individuals must sympathetically\ndebunk ourselves. Even though it does only a little good. But then," he\nshrugged, "if you go too far in that direction you can\'t pretend to lead. You\'ll\nlose your confidence. You won\'t believe enough in your own correctness to\nlead others. You must therefore have confidence in those who lead you -- in\nthe collective wisdom of Brotherhood."\nI left in a worse state than that in which I\'d come. Several buildings\naway I heard him call behind me, watched him approach through the dark.\n"You left your hat," he said, handing it to me along with the\nmimeographed sheets of instructions outlining the new program. I looked at\nthe hat and at him, thinking of Rinehart and invisibility, but knew that for\nhim it would have no reality. I told him good night and went through the\nhot street to Central Park West, starting toward Harlem.\nSacrifice and leadership, I thought. For him it was simple. For them\nit was simple. But hell, I was both. Both sacrificer and victim. I couldn\'t get\naway from that, and Hambro didn\'t have to deal with it. That was reality too,\nmy reality. He didn\'t have to put the knife blade to his own throat. What\nwould he say if he were the victim?\nI walked along the park in the dark. Cars passed. From time to time\nthe sound of voices, squealing laughter, arose from beyond the trees and\nhedges. I could smell the sun-singed grass. The sky against which an airplane\nbeacon played was still overcast. I thought of Jack, the people at the funeral,\nRinehart. They\'d asked us for bread and the best I could give was a glass eye\n-- not so much as an electric guitar.\nI stopped and dropped to a bench. I should leave, I thought. That\nwould be the honest thing to do. Otherwise I could only tell them to have\nhope and try to hold on to those who\'d listen. Was that also what Rinehart\nwas, a principle of hope for which they gladly paid? Otherwise there was\nnothing but betrayal, and that meant going back to serve Bledsoe, and\nEmerson, jumping from the pot of absurdity to the fire of the ridiculous. And\neither was a self-betrayal. But I couldn\'t leave; I had to settle with Jack and\nTobitt. I owed it to Clifton and Tarp and the others. I had to hold on ... and\nthen I had an idea that shook me profoundly: You don\'t have to worry about\nthe people. If they tolerate Rinehart, then they will forget it and even with\nthem you are invisible. It lasted only the fraction of a second and I rejected\nit immediately; still it had flashed across the dark sky of my mind. It was\njust like that. It didn\'t matter because they didn\'t realize just what had\nhappened, neither my hope nor my failure. My ambition and integrity were\nnothing to them and my failure was as meaningless as Clifton\'s. It had been\nthat way all along. Only in the Brotherhood had there seemed a chance for\nsuch as us, the mere glimmer of a light, but behind the polished and humane\nfa?de of Jack\'s eye I\'d found an amorphous form and a harsh red rawness.\nAnd even that was without meaning except for me.\nWell, I was and yet I was invisible, that was the fundamental\ncontradiction. I was and yet I was unseen. It was frightening and as I sat\nthere I sensed another frightening world of possibilities. For now I saw that I\ncould agree with Jack without agreeing. And I could tell Harlem to have hope\nwhen there was no hope. Perhaps I could tell them to hope until I found the\nbasis of something real, some firm ground for action that would lead them\nonto the plane of history. But until then I would have to move them without\nmyself being moved . . . I\'d have to do a Rinehart.\nI leaned against a stone wall along the park, thinking of Jack and\nHambro and of the day\'s events and shook with rage. It was all a swindle, an\nobscene swindle! They had set themselves up to describe the world. What did\nthey know of us, except that we numbered so many, worked on certain jobs,\noffered so many votes, and provided so many marchers for some protest\nparade of theirs! I leaned there, aching to humiliate them, to refute them.\nAnd now all past humiliations became precious parts of my experience, and\nfor the first time, leaning against that stone wall in the sweltering night, I\nbegan to accept my past and, as I accepted it, I felt memories welling up\nwithin me. It was as though I\'d learned suddenly to look around corners;\nimages of past humiliations flickered through my head and I saw that they\nwere more than separate experiences. They were me; they defined me. I was\nmy experiences and my experiences were me, and no blind men, no matter\nhow powerful they became, even if they conquered the world, could take that,\nor change one single itch, taunt, laugh, cry, scar, ache, rage or pain of it.\nThey were blind, bat blind, moving only by the echoed sounds of their own\nvoices. And because they were blind they would destroy themselves and I\'d\nhelp them. I laughed. Here I had thought they accepted me because they felt\nthat color made no difference, when in reality it made no difference because\nthey didn\'t see either color or men . . . For all they were concerned, we were\nso many names scribbled on fake ballots, to be used at their convenience and\nwhen not needed to be filed away. It was a joke, an absurd joke. And now I\nlooked around a corner of my mind and saw Jack and Norton and Emerson\nmerge into one single white figure. They were very much the same, each\nattempting to force his picture of reality upon me and neither giving a hoot\nin hell for how things looked to me. I was simply a material, a natural\nresource to be used. I had switched from the arrogant absurdity of Norton\nand Emerson to that of Jack and the Brotherhood, and it all came out the\nsame -- except I now recognized my invisibility.\nSo I\'d accept it, I\'d explore it, rine and heart. I\'d plunge into it with\nboth feet and they\'d gag. Oh, but wouldn\'t they gag. I didn\'t know what my\ngrandfather had meant, but I was ready to test his advice. I\'d overcome them\nwith yeses, undermine them with grins, I\'d agree them to death and\ndestruction. Yes, and I\'d let them swallow me until they vomited or burst\nwide open. Let them gag on what they refused to see. Let them choke on it.\nThat was one risk they hadn\'t calculated. That was a risk they had never\ndreamt of in their philosophy. Nor did they know that they could discipline\nthemselves to destruction, that saying "yes" could destroy them. Oh, I\'d yes\nthem, but wouldn\'t I yes them! I\'d yes them till they puked and rolled in it.\nAll they wanted of me was one belch of affirmation and I\'d bellow it out\nloud. Yesl Yes! YES! That was all anyone wanted of us, that we should be\nheard and not seen, and then heard only in one big optimistic chorus of\nyassuh, yassuh, yassuh! All right, I\'d yea, yea and oui, oui and si, si and see,\nsee them too; and I\'d walk around in their guts with hobnailed boots. Even\nthose super-big shots whom I\'d never seen at committee meetings. They\nwanted a machine? Very well, I\'d become a supersensitive confirmer of their\nmisconceptions, and just to hold their confidence I\'d try to be right part of\nthe time. Oh, I\'d serve them well and I\'d make invisibility felt if not seen,\nand they\'d learn that it could be as polluting as a decaying body, or a piece\nof bad meat in a stew. And if I got hurt? Very well again. Besides, didn\'t\nthey believe in sacrifice? They were the subtle thinkers -- would this be\ntreachery? Did the word apply to an invisible man? Could they recognize\nchoice in that which wasn\'t seen . . . ?\nThe more I thought of it the more I fell into a kind of morbid\nfascination with the possibility. Why hadn\'t I discovered it sooner? How\ndifferent my life might have been! How terribly different! Why hadn\'t I seen\nthe possibilities? If a sharecropper could attend college by working during the\nsummers as a waiter and factory hand or as a musician and then graduate to\nbecome a doctor, why couldn\'t all those things be done at one and the same\ntime? And wasn\'t that old slave a scientist -- or at least called one,\nrecognized as one -- even when he stood with hat in hand, bowing and\nscraping in senile and obscene servility? My God, what possibilities existed!\nAnd that spiral business, that progress goo! Who knew all the secrets; hadn\'t\nI changed my name and never been challenged even once? And that lie that\nsuccess was a rising upward. What a crummy lie they kept us dominated by.\nNot only could you travel upward toward success but you could travel\ndownward as well; up and down, in retreat as well as in advance, crabways\nand crossways and around in a circle, meeting your old selves coming and\ngoing and perhaps all at the same time. How could I have missed it for so\nlong? Hadn\'t I grown up around gambler-politicians, bootlegger-judges and\nsheriffs who were burglars; yes, and Klansmen who were preachers and\nmembers of humanitarian societies? Hell, and hadn\'t Bledsoe tried to tell me\nwhat it was all about? I felt more dead than alive. It had been quite a day;\none that could not have been more shattering even if I had learned that the\nman whom I\'d always called father was actually of no relation to me.\nI went to the apartment and fell across the bed in my clothes. It was\nhot and the fan did little more than stir the heat in heavy leaden waves,\nbeneath which I lay twirling the dark glasses and watching the hypnotic\nflickering of the lenses as I tried to make plans. I would hide my anger and\nlull them to sleep; assure them that the community was in full agreement\nwith their program. And as proof I would falsify the attendance records by\nfilling out membership cards with fictitious names -- all unemployed, of\ncourse, so as to avoid any question of dues. Yes, and I would move about the\ncommunity by night and during times of danger by wearing the white hat\nand the dark glasses. It was a dreary prospect but a means of destroying\nthem, at least in Harlem. I saw no possibility of organizing a splinter\nmovement, for what would be the next step? Where would we go? There were\nno allies with whom we could join as equals; nor were there time or theorists\navailable to work out an over-all program of our own -- although I felt that\nsomewhere between Rinehart and invisibility there were great potentialities.\nBut we had no money, no intelligence apparatus, either in government,\nbusiness or labor unions; and no communications with our own people except\nthrough unsympathetic newspapers, a few Pullman porters who brought\nprovincial news from distant cities and a group of domestics who reported the\nfairly uninteresting private lives of their employers. If only we had some true\nfriends, some who saw us as more than convenient tools for shaping their\nown desires! But to hell with that, I thought, I would remain and become a\nwell-disciplined optimist, and help them to go merrily to hell. If I couldn\'t\nhelp them to see the reality of our lives I would help them to ignore it until\nit exploded in their faces.\nOnly one thing bothered me: Since I now knew that their real\nobjectives were never revealed at committee meetings I needed some channel\nof intelligence through which I could learn what actually guided their\noperations. But how? If only I had resisted being shifted downtown I would\nnow have enough support in the community to insist that they reveal\nthemselves. Yes, but if I hadn\'t been shifted, I would still be living in a world\nof illusion. But now that I had found the thread of reality, how could I hold\non? They seemed to have me blocked at every turn, forcing me to fight them\nin the dark. Finally I tossed the glasses across the bed and dropped into a\nfitful nap during which I relived the events of the last few days; except that\ninstead ot Clifton being lost it was myself, and I awoke stale, sweaty and\naware of perfume.\nI lay on my stomach, my head resting upon the back of my hand\nthinking, where is it coming from? And just as I caught sight ot the glasses I\nremembered grasping Rinehart\'s girl\'s hand. I lay there unmoving, and she\nseemed to perch on the bed, a bright-eyed bird with her glossy head and ripe\nbreasts, and I was in a wood afraid to frighten the bird away. Then I was\nfully awake and the bird gone and the girl\'s image in my mind. What would\nhave happened if I had led her on, how far could I have gone? A desirable\ngirl like that mixed up with Rinehart. And now I sat breathless, asking myself\nhow Rinehart would have solved the problem of information and it came\ninstantly clear: It called for a woman. A wife, a girl friend, or secretary of\none ot the leaders, who would be willing to talk freely to me. My mind swept\nback to early experiences in the movement. Little incidents sprang to memory,\nbringing images of the smiles and gestures of certain women met after rallies\nand at parties: Dancing with Emma at the Chthonian; she close, soft against\nme and the hot swift focusing of my desire and my embarrassment as I\ncaught sight of Jack holding forth in a corner, and Emma holding me tight,\nher bound breasts pressing against me, looking with that teasing light in her\neyes saying, "Ah, temptation," and my desperate grab for a sophisticated reply\nand managing only, "Oh, but there\'s always temptation," surprising myself\nnevertheless and hearing her laughing, "Touche! Touche! You should come up\nand fence with me some afternoon." That had been during the early days\nwhen I had felt strong restrictions and resented Emma\'s boldness and her\nopinion that I should have been blacker to play my role of Harlem leader.\nWell, there were no restrictions left, the committee had seen to that. She was\nfair game and perhaps she\'d find me black enough, after all. A committee\nmeeting was set for tomorrow, and since it was Jack\'s birthday, a party at\nthe Chthonian would follow. Thus I would launch my two-pronged attack\nunder the most favorable circumstance. They were forcing me to Rinehart\nmethods, so bring on the scientists!\nChapter 24\nI started yessing them the next day and it began beautifully. The\ncommunity was still going apart at the seams. Crowds formed at the slightest\nincidents. Store windows were smashed and several clashes erupted during the\nmorning between bus drivers and their passengers. The papers listed similar\nincidents that had exploded during the night. The mirrored fa?de of one store\non 125th Street was smashed and I passed to see a group of boys watching\ntheir distorted images as they danced before the jagged glass. A group of\nadults looked on, refusing to move at the policemen\'s command, and\nmuttering about Clifton. I didn\'t like the look of things, for all my wish to\nsee the committee confounded.\nWhen I reached the office, members were there with reports of\nclashes in other parts of the district. I didn\'t like it at all; the violence was\npointless and, helped along by Ras, was actually being directed against the\ncommunity itself. Yet in spite of my sense of violated responsibility I was\npleased by the developments and went ahead with my plan. I sent out\nmembers to mingle with crowds and try to discourage any further violence\nand sent an open letter to all the press denouncing them for "distorting" and\ninflating minor incidents.\nLate that afternoon at headquarters I reported that things were\nquieting down and that we were getting a large part of the community\ninterested in a clean-up campaign, which would clear all backyards, areaways,\nand vacant lots of garbage and trash and take Harlem\'s mind off Clifton. It\nwas such a bareface maneuver that I almost lost the confidence of my\ninvisibility even as I stood before them. But they loved it, and when I handed\nin my fake list of new members they responded with enthusiasm. They were\nvindicated; the program was correct, events were progressing in their\npredetermined direction, history was on their side, and Harlem loved them. I\nsat there smiling inwardly as I listened to the remarks that followed. I could\nsee the role which I was to play as plainly as I saw Jack\'s red hair. Incidents\nof my past, both recognized and ignored, sprang together in my mind in an\nironic leap of consciousness that was like looking around a corner. I was to\nbe a justifier, my task would be to deny the unpredictable human element of\nall Harlem so that they could ignore it when it in any way interfered with\ntheir plans. I was to keep ever before them the picture of a bright, passive,\ngood-humored, receptive mass ever willing to accept their every scheme. When\nsituations arose in which others would respond with righteous anger I would\nsay that we were calm and unruffled (if it suited them to have us angry, then\nit was simple enough to create anger for us by stating it in their propaganda;\nthe facts were unimportant, unreal); and if other people were confused by\ntheir maneuvering I was to reassure them that we pierced to the truth with\nx-ray insight. If other groups were interested in becoming wealthy, I was to\nassure the Brothers and the doubting members of other districts, that we\nrejected wealth as corrupt and intrinsically degrading; if other minorities loved\nthe country despite their grievances, I would assure the committee that we,\nimmune to such absurdly human and mixed reactions, hated it absolutely;\nand, greatest contradiction of all, when they denounced the American scene as\ncorrupt and degenerate, I was to say that we, though snarled inextricably\nwithin its veins and sinews, were miraculously healthy. Yessuh, yessuh!\nThough invisible I would be their assuring voice of denial; I\'d out-Tobitt\nTobitt, and as for that outhouse Wrestrum -- well. As I sat there one of them\nwas inflating my faked memberships into meanings of national significance.\nAn illusion was creating a counter-illusion. Where would it end? Did they\nbelieve their own propaganda?\nAfterwards at the Chthonian it was like old times. Jack\'s birthday\nwas an occasion for champagne and the hot, dog-day evening was even more\nvolatile than usual. I felt highly confident, but here my plan went slightly\nwrong. Emma was quite gay and responsive, but something about her hard,\nhandsome face warned me to lay off. I sensed that while she might willingly\nsurrender herself (in order to satisfy herself) she was far too sophisticated\nand skilled in intrigue to compromise her position as Jack\'s mistress by\nrevealing anything important to me. So as I danced and sparred with Emma I\nlooked over the party for a second choice.\nWe were thrown together at the bar. Her name was Sybil and she\nwas one of those who assumed that my lectures on the woman question were\nbased upon a more intimate knowledge than the merely political and had\nindicated several times a willingness to know me better. I had always\npretended not to understand, for not only had my first such experience taught\nme to avoid such situations, but at the Chthonian she was usually slightly\ntipsy and wistful -- just the type of misunderstood married woman whom,\neven if I had been interested, I would have avoided like the plague. But now\nher unhappiness and the fact that she was one of the big shot\'s wives made\nher a perfect choice. She was very lonely and it went very smoothly. In the\nnoisy birthday party -- which was to be followed by a public celebration the\nnext evening -- we weren\'t noticed, and when she left fairly early in the\nevening I saw her home. She felt neglected and he was always busy, and\nwhen I left her I had arranged a rendezvous at my apartment for the\nfollowing evening. George, the husband, would be at the birthday celebration\nand she wouldn\'t be missed.\nIT WAS a hot dry August night. Lightning flashed across the eastern\nsky and a breathless tension was in the humid air. I had spent the afternoon\npreparing, leaving the office on a pretense of illness to avoid having to attend\nthe celebration. I had neither itch nor etchings, but there was a vase of\nChinese lilies in the living room, and another of American Beauty roses on\nthe table near the bed; and I had put in a supply of wine, whiskey and\nliqueur, extra ice cubes, and assortments of fruit, cheese, nuts, candy and\nother delicacies from the Vendome. In short, I tried to manage things as I\nimagined Rinehart would have done.\nBut I bungled it from the beginning. I made the drinks too strong --\nwhich she liked too well; and I brought up politics -- which she all but hated\n-- too early in the evening. For all her exposure to ideology she had no\ninterest in politics and no idea of the schemes that occupied her husband\nnight and day. She was more interested in the drinks, in which I had to join\nher glass for glass, and in little dramas which she had dreamed up around\nthe figures of Joe Louis and Paul Robeson. And, although I had neither the\nstature nor the temperament for either role, I was expected either to sing\n"Old Man River" and just keep rolling along, or to do fancy tricks with my\nmuscles. I was confounded and amused and it became quite a contest, with\nme trying to keep the two of us in touch with reality and with her casting\nme in fantasies in which I was Brother\nTaboo-with-whom-all-things-are-possible.\nNow it was late and as I came into the room with another round of\ndrinks she had let down her hair and was beckoning to me with a gold\nhairpin in her teeth, saying, "Come to mamma, beautiful," from where she sat\non the bed.\n"Your drink, madame," I said, handing her a glass and hoping the\nfresh drink would discourage any new ideas.\n"Come on, dear," she said coyly. "I want to ask you something."\n"What is it?" I said.\n"I have to whisper it, beautiful."\nI sat and her lips came close to my ear. And suddenly she had\ndrained the starch out of me. I pulled away. There was something almost\nprim about the way she sat there, and yet she had just made a modest\nproposal that I join her in a very revolting ritual.\n"What was that!" I said, and she repeated it. Had life suddenly\nbecome a crazy Thurber cartoon?\n"Please, you\'ll do that for me, won\'t you, beautiful?"\n"You really mean it?"\n"Yes," she said, "yes!"\nThere was a pristine incorruptibility about her face now that upset\nme all the more, for she was neither kidding nor trying to insult me; and I\ncould not tell if it were horror speaking to me ont of innocence, or innocence\nemerging unscathed from the obscene scheme of the evening. I only knew\nthat the whole affair was a mistake. She had no information and I decided to\nget her out of the apartment before I had to deal definitely with either the\nhorror or the innocence, while I could still deal with it as a joke. What\nwould Rinehart do about this, I thought, and knowing, determined not to let\nher provoke me to violence.\n"But, Sybil, you can see I\'m not like that. You make me feel a\ntender, protective passion -- Look, it\'s like an oven in here, why don\'t we get\ndressed and go for a walk in Central Park?"\n"But I need it," she said, uncrossing her thighs and sitting up\neagerly. "You can do it, it\'ll be easy for you, beautiful. Threaten to kill me if\nI don\'t give in. You know, talk rough to me, beautiful. A friend of mine said\nthe fellow said, \'Drop your drawers\' . . . and --"\n"He said what!" I said.\n"He really did," she said.\nI looked at her. She was blushing, her cheeks, even her freckled\nbosom, were bright red.\n"Go on," I said, as she lay back again. "Then what happened?"\n"Well . . . he called her a filthy name," she said, hesitating coyly.\nShe was a leathery old girl with chestnut hair of fine natural wave which was\nnow fanned out over the pillow. She was blushing quite deeply. Was this\nmeant to excite me, or was it an unconscious expression of revulsion?\n"A really filthy name," she said. "Oh, he was a brute, huge, with\nwhite teeth, what they call a \'buck.\' And he said, \'Bitch, drop your drawers,\'\nand then he did it. She\'s such a lovely girl, too, really delicate with a\ncomplexion like strawberries and cream. You can\'t imagine anyone calling her\na name like that."\nShe sat up now, her elbows denting the pillow as she looked into my\nface.\n"But what happened, did they catch him?" I said.\n"Oh, of course not, beautiful, she only told two of us girls. She\ncouldn\'t afford to let her husband hear of it. He . . . well, it\'s too long a\nstory."\n"It\'s terrible," I said. "Don\'t you think we should go . . . ?"\n"Isn\'t it, though? She was in a state for months . . ." her expression\nflickered, became indeterminate.\n"What is it?" I said, afraid she might cry.\n"Oh, I was just wondering how she really felt. I really do." Suddenly\nshe looked at me mysteriously. "Can I trust you with a deep secret?"\nI sat up. "Don\'t tell me that it was you."\nShe smiled, "Oh, no, that was a dear friend of mine. But do you\nknow what, beautiful," she said leaning forward confidentially, "I think I\'m a\nnymphomaniac."\n"You? Noooo!"\n"Uh huh. Sometimes I have such thoughts and dreams. I never give\ninto them though, but I really think I am. A woman like me has to develop\nan iron discipline."\nI laughed inwardly. She would soon be a biddy, stout, with a little\ndouble chin and a three-ply girdle. A thin gold chain showed around a\nthickening ankle. And yet I was becoming aware of something warmly,\ninfuriatingly feminine about her. I reached out, stroking her hand. "Why do\nyou have such ideas about yourself?" I said, seeing her raise up and pluck at\nthe corner of the pillow, drawing out a speckled feather and stripping the\ndown from its shaft.\n"Repression," she said with great sophistication. "Men have repressed\nus too much. We\'re expected to pass up too many human things. But do you\nknow another secret?"\nI bowed my head.\n"You don\'t mind my going on, do you, beautiful?"\n"No, Sybil."\n"Well, ever since I first heard about it, even when I was a very little\ngirl, I\'ve wanted it to happen to me."\n"You mean what happened to your friend?"\n"Uh huh."\n"Good Lord, Sybil, did you ever tell that to anyone else?"\n"Of course not, I wouldn\'t\'ve dared. Are you shocked?"\n"Some. But Sybil, why do you tell me?"\n"Oh, I know that I can trust you. I just knew you\'d understand;\nyou\'re not like other men. We\'re kind of alike."\nShe was smiling now and reached out and pushed me gently, and I\nthought, here it goes again.\n"Lie back and let me look at you against that white sheet. You\'re\nbeautiful, I\'ve always thought so. Like warm ebony against pure snow -- see\nwhat you do, you make me talk poetry. \'Warm ebony against pure snow,\' isn\'t\nthat poetic?"\n"I\'m the sensitive type, you musn\'t make fun of me."\n"But really you are, and I feel so free with you. You\'ve no idea."\nI looked at the red imprint left by the straps of her bra, thinking,\nWho\'s taking revenge on whom? But why be surprised, when that\'s what they\nhear all their lives. When it\'s made into a great power and they\'re taught to\nworship all types of power? With all the warnings against it, some are bound\nto want to try it out for themselves. The conquerors conquered. Maybe a\ngreat number secretly want it; maybe that\'s why they scream when it\'s\nfarthest from possibility --\n"That\'s it," she said tightly. "Look at me like that; just like you want\nto tear me apart. I love for you to look at me like that!"\nI laughed and touched her chin. She had me on the ropes; I felt\npunch drunk, I couldn\'t deliver and I couldn\'t be angry either. I thought of\nlecturing her on the respect due one\'s bedmate in our society, but I no longer\ndeluded myself that I either knew the society or where I fitted into it.\nBesides, I thought, she thinks you\'re an entertainer. That\'s something else\nthey\'re taught.\nI raised my glass and she joined me in a drink, moving close.\n"You will, won\'t you, beautiful?" she said, her lips, raw-looking now\nwithout makeup, pouting babyishly. So why not entertain her, be a gentleman,\nor whatever it is she thinks you are -- What does she think you are? A\ndomesticated rapist, obviously, an expert on the woman question. Maybe that\'s\nwhat you are, house-broken and with a convenient verbal push-button\narrangement for the ladies\' pleasure. Well, so I had set this trap for myself.\n"Take this," I said, shoving another glass into her hand. "It\'ll be\nbetter after you\'ve had a drink, more realistic."\n"Oh, yes, that\'ll be wonderful." She took a drink and looked up\nthoughtfully. "I get so tired of living the way I do, beautiful. Soon I\'ll be old\nand nothing will\'ve happened to me. Do you know what that means? George\ntalks a lot about women\'s rights, but what does he know about what a\nwoman needs? Him with his forty minutes of brag and ten of bustle. Oh, you\nhave no idea what you\'re doing for me."\n"Nor you for me, Sybil dear," I said, filling the glass again. At last\nmy drinks were beginning to work.\nShe shook her long hair out over her shoulders and crossed her\nknees, watching me. Her head had begun to weave.\n"Don\'t drink too much, beautiful," she said. "It always takes the pep\nout of George."\n"Don\'t worry," I said. "I rapes real good when I\'m drunk."\nShe looked startled. "Ooooh, then pour me another," she said, giving\nherself a bounce. She was as delighted as a child, holding out her glass\neagerly.\n"What\'s happening here," I said, "a new birth of a nation?"\n"What\'d you say, beautiful?"\n"Nothing, a bad joke. Forget it."\n"That\'s what I like about you, beautiful. You haven\'t told me a single\none of those vulgar jokes. Come on, beautiful," she said, "pour."\nI poured her another and another; in fact, I poured us both quite a\nfew. I was far away; it wasn\'t happening to me or to her and I felt a certain\nconfused pity which I didn\'t wish to feel. Then she looked at me, her eyes\nbright behind narrowed lids and raised up and struck me where it hurt.\n"Come on, beat me, daddy -- you -- you big black bruiser. What\'s\ntaking you so long?" she said. "Hurry up, knock me down! Don\'t you want\nme?"\nI was annoyed enough to slap her. She lay aggressively receptive,\nflushed, her navel no goblet but a pit in an earth-quaking land, flexing taut\nand expansive. Then she said, "Come on, come on!" and I said, "Sure, sure,"\nlooking around wildly and starting to pour the drink upon her and was\nstopped, my emotions locked, as I saw her lipstick lying on the table and\ngrabbed it, saying, "Yes, yes," as I bent to write furiously across her belly in\ndrunken inspiration:\nSYBIL, YOU WERE RAPED\nBY\nSANTA CLAUS\nSURPRISE\nand paused there, trembling above her, my knees on the bed as she waited\nwith unsteady expectancy. It was a purplish metallic shade of lipstick and as\nshe panted with anticipation the letters stretched and quivered, up hill and\ndown dale, and she was lit up like a luminescent sign.\n"Hurry, boo\'ful, hurry," she said.\nI looked at her, thinking, Just wait until George sees that -- if\nGeorge ever gets around to seeing that. He\'ll read a lecture on an aspect of\nthe woman question he\'s never thought about. She lay anonymous beneath my\neyes until I saw her face, shaped by her emotion which I could not fulfill,\nand I thought, Poor Sybil, she picked a boy for a man\'s job and nothing was\nas it was supposed to be. Even the black bruiser fell down on the job. She\'d\nlost control of her liquor now and suddenly I bent and kissed her upon the\nlips.\n"Shhh, be quiet," I said, "that\'s no way to act when you\'re being --"\nand she raised her lips for more and I kissed her again and calmed her and\nshe dozed off and I decided again to end the farce. Such games were for\nRinehart, not me. I stumbled out and got a damp towel and began rubbing\nout the evidence of my crime. It was as tenacious as sin and it took some\ntime. Water wouldn\'t do it, whiskey would have smelled and finally I had to\nfind benzine. Fortunately she didn\'t arouse until I was almost finished.\n"D\'you do it, boo\'ful?" she said.\n"Yes, of course," I said. "Isn\'t that what you wanted?"\n"Yes, but I don\'t seem t\'remember . . ."\nI looked at her and wanted to laugh. She was trying to see me but\nher eyes wouldn\'t focus am aer head kept swinging to one side, yet she was\nmaking a real effort, and suddenly I felt lighthearted.\n"By the way," I said, trying to do something with her hair, "what\'s\nyour name, lady?"\n"It\'s Sybil," she said indignantly, almost tearfully. "Boo\'ful, you know\nI\'m Sybil."\n"Not when I grabbed you, I didn\'t."\nHer eyes widened and a smile wobbled across her face.\n"That\'s right, you couldn\'t, could you? You never saw me before." She\nwas delighted, I could almost see the idea take form in her mind.\n"That\'s right," I said. "I leaped straight out of the wall. I\noverpowered you in the empty lobby -- remember? I smothered your terrified\nscreams."\n" \'N\' did I put up a good fight?"\n"Like a lioness defending her young . . ."\n"But you were such a strong big brute you made me give in. I didn\'t\nwant to, did I now, boo\'ful? You forced me \'gainst m\' will."\n"Sure," I said, picking up some silken piece of clothing. "You brought\nout the beast in me. I overpowered you. But what could I do?"\nShe studied that a while and for a second her face worked again as\nthough she would cry. But it was another smile that bloomed there.\n"And wasn\'t I a good nymphomaniac?" she said, watching me closely.\n"Really and truly?"\n"You have no idea," I said. "George had better keep an eye on you."\nShe twisted herself from side to side with irritation. "Oh, nuts! That\nole Georgie porgie wouldn\'t know a nymphomaniac if she got right into bed\nwith him!"\n"You\'re wonderful," I said. "Tell me about George. Tell me about that\ngreat master mind of social change."\nShe steadied her gaze, frowning. "Who, Georgie?" she said, looking at\nme out of one bleary eye. "Georgie\'s blind \'sa mole in a hole \'n doesn\'t know\na thing about it. \'D you ever hear of such a thing, fifteen years! Say, what\'re\nyou laughing at, boo\'ful?"\n"Me," I said, beginning to roar, "just me . . ."\n"I\'ve never seen anyone laugh like you, boo\'ful. It\'s wonderful!"\nI was slipping her dress over her head now and her voice came\nmuffled through the shantung cloth. Then I had it down around her hips and\nher flushed face wavered through the collar, her hair down in disorder again.\n"Boo\'ful," she said, blowing the word, "will you do it again\nsometimes?"\nI stepped away and looked at her. "What?"\n"Please, pretty boo\'ful, please," she said with a wobbly smile.\nI began to laugh, "Sure," I said, "sure . . ."\n"When, boo\'ful, when?"\n"Any time," I said. "How about every Thursday at nine?"\n"Oooooh, boo\'ful," she said, giving me an old-fashioned hug. "I\'ve\nnever seen anyone like you."\n"Are you sure?" I said.\n"Really, I haven\'t, boo\'ful . . . Honor bright . . . believe me?"\n"Sure, it\'s good to be seen, but we\'ve got to go now," I said seeing\nher about to sag to the bed.\nShe pouted. "I need a lil nightcap, boo\'ful," she said.\n"You\'ve had enough," I said.\n"Ah, boo\'ful, jus\' one . . ."\n"Okay, just one."\nWe had another drink and I looked at her and felt the pity and\nself-disgust returning and was depressed.\nShe looked at me gravely, her head to one side.\n"Boo\'ful," she said, "you know what lil ole Sybil thinks? She thinks\nyou\'re trying to get rid of her."\nI looked at her out of a deep emptiness and refilled her glass and\nmine. What had I done to her, allowed her to do? Had all of it filtered down\nto me? My action . . . my -- the painful word formed as disconnectedly as\nher wobbly smile -- my responsibility? All of it? I\'m invisible. "Here," I said,\n"drink."\n"You too, boo\'ful," she said.\n"Yes," I said. She moved into my arms.\nI MUST have dozed. There came the tinkling of ice in a glass, the\nshrill of bells. I felt profoundly sad, as though winter had fallen during the\nhour. She lay, her chestnut hair let down, watching through heavy-lidded,\nblue, eye-shadowed eyes. From far away a new sound arose.\n"Don\'t answer, boo\'ful," she said, her voice coming through suddenly,\nout of time with the working of her mouth.\n"What?" I said.\n"Don\'t answer, let\'er ring," she said, reaching her red-nailed fingers\nforth.\nI took it from her hands, understanding now.\n"Don\'t, boo\'ful," she said.\nIt rang again in my hand now and for no reason at all the words of\na childhood prayer spilled through my mind like swift water. Then: "Hello," I\nsaid.\nIt was a frantic, unrecognizable voice from the district. "Brother, you\nbetter get up here right away --" it said.\n"I\'m ill," I said. "What\'s wrong?"\n"There\'s trouble, Brother, and you\'re the only one who can --"\n"What kind of trouble?"\n"Bad trouble, Brother; they trying to --"\nThen the harsh sound of breaking glass, distant, brittle and fine,\nfollowed by a crash, and the line went dead.\n"Hello," I said, seeing Sybil wavering before me, her lips saying,\n"Boo\'ful."\nI tried to dial now, hearing the busy signal throbbing back at me:\nAmen-Amen-Amen Ah man; and I sat there a while. Was it a trick? Did they\nknow she was with me? I put it down. Her eyes were looking at me from\nout of their blue shadow. "Boo --"\nAnd now I stood and pulled her arm. "Let\'s go, Sybil. They need me\nuptown" -- realizing only then that I would go.\n\'"No," she said.\ns\'"But yes. Come."\nShe fell back upon the bed defying me. I released her arms and\nlooked around, my head unclear. What kind of trouble at this hour? Why\nshould I go? She watched me, her eyes brightly awash in blue shadow. My\nheart felt low and deeply sad.\n"Come back, boo\'ful," she said.\n"No, let\'s get some air," I said.\nAnd now, avoiding the red, oily nails I gripped her wrists and pulled\nher up, toward the door. We tottered, her lips brushing mine as we wavered\nthere. She clung to me and, for an instant, I to her with a feeling\nimmeasurably sad. Then she hiccupped and I looked vacantly back into the\nroom. The light caught in the amber liquid of our glasses.\n"Boo\'ful," she said, "life could be so diff\'rent --"\n"But it never is," I said.\nShe said, "Boo\'ful."\nThe fan whirred. And in a corner, my brief case, covered with specks\nof dust like memories -- the night of the battle royal. I felt her breathing hot\nagainst me and pushed her gently away, steadying her against the door frame,\nthen went over as impulsively as the remembered prayer, and got the brief\ncase, brushing the dust against my leg and feeling the unexpected weight as I\nhugged it beneath my arm. Something clinked inside.\nShe watched me still, her eyes alight as I took her arm.\n"How\'re you doing, Syb?" I said.\n"Don\'t go, boo\'ful," she said. "Let Georgie do it. No speeches tonight."\n"Come on," I said, taking her arm quite firmly, pulling her along as\nshe sighed, her wistful face turned toward me.\nWe went down smoothly into the street. My head was still badly\nfuzzed from the drink, and when I looked down the huge emptiness of the\ndark I felt like tears . . . What was happening uptown? Why should I worry\nover bureaucrats, blind men? I am invisible. I stared down the quiet street,\nfeeling her stumbling beside me, humming a little tune; something fresh, na?e\nand carefree. Sybil, my too-late-too-early love . . . Ah! My throat throbbed.\nThe heat of the street clung close. I looked for a taxi but none was passing.\nShe hummed beside me, her perfume unreal in the night. We moved into the\nnext block and still no taxis. Her high heels unsteadily scrunched the walk. I\nstopped her.\n"Poor boo\'ful," she said. "Don\'t know his name . . ."\nI turned as though struck. "What?"\n"Anonymous brute \'n boo\'ful buck," she said, her mouth a bleary\nsmile.\nI looked at her, skittering about on high heels, scrunch, scrunch on\nthe walk.\n"Sybil," I said, more to myself than to her, "where will it end?"\nSomething told me to go.\n"Aaaah," she laughed, "in bed. Don\'t go up, boo\'ful, Sybil\'ll tuck you\nin."\nI shook my head. The stars were there, high, high, revolving. Then I\nclosed my eyes and they sailed red behind my lids; then somewhat steadied I\ntook her arm.\n"Look, Sybil," I said, "stand here a minute while I go over to Fifth\nfor a taxi. Stand right here, dear, and hold on."\nWe tottered before an ancient-looking building, its windows dark.\nHuge Greek medallions showed in spots of light upon its fa?de, above a dark\nlabyrinthine pattern in the stone, and I propped her against the stoop with\nits carved stone monster. She leaned there, her hair wild, looking at me in\nthe street light, smiling. Her face kept swinging to one side, her right eye\ndesperately closed.\n"Sure, boo\'ful, sure," she said.\n"I\'ll be right back," I said, backing away.\n"Boo\'ful," she called, "My boo\'ful."\nHear the true affection, I thought, the adoration of the Boogie Bear,\nmoving away. Was she calling me beautiful or boogieful, beautiful or sublime\n. . . What\'d either mean? I am invisible . . .\nI went on through the late street quiet, hoping that a cab would pass\nbefore I had gone all the way. Up ahead at Fifth the lights were bright, a\nfew cars shooting across the gaping mouth of the street and above and\nbeyond, the trees -- great, dark, tall. What was going on, I pondered. Why\ncall for me so late -- and who?\nI hurried ahead, my feet unsteady.\n"Booo\'ful," she called behind me, "boooooo\'ful!"\nI waved without looking back. Never again, no more, no more. I\nwent on.\nAt Fifth a cab passed and I tried to hail it, only to hear someone\'s\nvoice arise, the sound floating gaily by. I looked up the lighted avenue for\nanother, hearing suddenly the screech of brakes and turning to see the cab\nstop and a white arm beckoning. The cab reversed, rolled close, settling with\na bounce. I laughed. It was Sybil. I stumbled forward, came to the door. She\nsmiled out at me, her head, framed in the window, still pulling to one side,\nher hair waving down.\n"Get in, boo\'ful, \'n take me to Harlem . . ."\nI shook my head, feeling it heavy and sad. "No," I said, "I\'ve got\nwork to do, Sybil. You\'d better go home . . ."\n"No, boo\'ful, take me with you."\nI turned to the driver, my hand upon the door. He was small,\ndark-haired and disapproving, a glint of red from the traffic light coloring the\ntip of his nose.\n"Look," I said, "take her home."\nI gave him the address and my last five-dollar bill. He took it,\nglumly disapproving.\n"No, boo\'ful," she said, "I want to go to Harlem, be with you!"\n"Good night," I said, stepping back from the curb.\nWe were in the middle of the block and I saw them pull away.\n"No," she said, "no, boo\'ful. Don\'t leave . . ." Her face, wild-eyed and\nwhite, showed in the door. I stood there, watching him plunge swiftly and\ncontemptuously out of sight, his tail light as red as his nose.\nI walked with eyes closed, seeming to float and trying to clear my\nhead, then opened them and crossed to the park side, along the cobbles.\nHigh above, the cars sailed round and round the drive, their headlights\nstabbing. All the taxies were hired, all going downtown. Center of gravity. I\nplodded on, my head awhirl.\nThen near 110th Street I saw her again. She was waiting beneath a\nstreet lamp, waving. I wasn\'t surprised; I had become fatalistic. I came up\nslowly, hearing her laugh. She was ahead of me and beginning to run,\nbarefoot, loosely, as in a dream. Running. Unsteadily but swift and me\nsurprised and unable to catch up, lead-legged, seeing her ahead and calling,\n"Sybil, Sybil!" running lead-legged along the park side.\n"Come on, boo\'ful," she called, looking back and stumbling. "Catch\nSybil . . . Sybil," running barefoot and girdleless along the park.\nI ran, the brief case heavy beneath my arm. Something told me I\nhad to get to the office . . . "Sybil, wait!" I called.\nShe ran, the colors of her dress flaring flamelike in the bright places\nof the dark. A rustling motion, legs working awkwardly beneath her and white\nheels flashing, her skirts held high. Let her go, I thought. But now she was\ncrossing the street and running wildly only to go down at the curb and\nstanding and going down again, with a bumped backside, completely unsteady,\nnow that her momentum was gone.\n"Boo\'ful," she said as I came up. "Damn, boo\'ful, you push me?"\n"Get up," I said without anger. "Get up," taking her soft arm. She\nstood, her arms flung wide for an embrace.\n"No," I said, "this isn\'t Thursday. I\'ve got to get there . . . What do\nthey plan for me, Sybil?"\n"Who, boo\'ful?"\n"Jack and George . . . Tobitt and all?"\n"You ran me down, boo\'ful," she said. "Forget them . . . bunch of\ndead-heads . . . unhipped, y\'know. We didn\'t make this stinking world,\nboo\'ful. Forget --"\nI saw the taxi just in time, approaching swiftly from the corner, a\ndouble-decker bus looming two blocks behind. The cabbie looked over, his\nhead out of the window, sitting high at the wheel as he made a swift U-turn\nand came alongside. His face was shocked, disbelieving.\n"Come now, Sybil," I said, "and no tricks."\n"Pardon me, old man," the driver said, his voice concerned, "but\nyou\'re not taking her up in Harlem are you?"\n"No, the lady\'s going downtown," I said. "Get in Sybil."\n"Boo\'ful\'s \'n ole dictator," she said to the driver, who looked at me\nsilently, as though I were mad.\n"A game stud," he muttered, "a most game stud!"\nBut she got in.\n"Just \'n ole dictator, boo\'ful."\n"Look," I told him, "take her straight home and don\'t let her get out\nof the cab. I don\'t want her running around Harlem. She\'s precious, a great\nlady --"\n"Sure, man, I don\'t blame you," he said. "Things is popping up\nthere."\nThe cab was already rolling as I yelled, "What\'s going on?"\n"They\'re taking the joint apart," he called above the shifting of the\ngears. I watched them go and made for the bus stop. This time I\'ll make\nsure, I thought, stepping out and flagging the bus and getting on. If she\ncomes back, she\'ll find me gone. And I knew stronger than ever that I should\nhurry but was still too foggy in my mind, couldn\'t get myself together.\nI sat gripping my brief case, my eyes closed, feeling the bus sailing\nswift beneath me. Soon it would turn up Seventh Avenue. Sybil, forgive me, I\nthought. The bus rolled.\nBut when I opened my eyes we were turning into Riverside Drive.\nThis too I accepted calmly, the whole night was out of joint. I\'d had too\nmany drinks. Time ran fluid, invisible, sad. Looking out I could see a ship\nmoving upstream, its running lights bright points in the night. The cool sea\nsmell came through to me, constant and thick in the swiftly unfolding blur of\nanchored boats, dark water and lights pouring past. Across the river was\nJersey and I remembered my entry into Harlem. Long past, I thought, long\npast. I was as if drowned in the river.\nTo my right and ahead the church spire towered high, crowned with\na red light of warning. And now we were passing the hero\'s tomb and I\nrecalled a visit there. You went up the steps and inside and you looked far\nbelow to find him, at rest, draped flags . . .\nOne Hundred and Twenty-fifth Street came quickly. I stumbled off,\nhearing the bus pull away as I faced the water. There was a light breeze, but\nnow with the motion gone the heat returned, clinging. Far ahead in the dark\nI saw the monumental bridge, ropes of lights across the dark river; and\ncloser, high above the shoreline, the Palisades, their revolutionary agony lost\nin the riotous lights of roller coasters. "The Time Is Now . . ." the sign\nacross the river began, but with history stomping upon me with hobnailed\nboots, I thought with a laugh, why worry about time? I crossed the street to\nthe drinking fountain, feeling the water cooling, going down, then dampened a\nhandkerchief and swabbed my face, eyes. The water flashed, gurgled, sprayed.\nI pressed forward my face, feeling wet cool, hearing the infant joy of\nfountains. Then heard the other sound. It was not the river nor the curving\ncars that flashed through the dark, but pitched like a distant crowd or a swift\nriver at floodtide.\nI moved forward, found the steps and started down. Below the bridge\nlay the hard stone river of the street, and for a second I looked at the waves\nof cobblestones as though I expected water, as though the fountain above had\ndrawn from them. Still I would enter and go across to Harlem. Below the\nsteps the trolley rails gleamed steely. I hurried, the sound drawing closer,\nmyriad-voiced, humming, enfolding me, numbing the air, as I started beneath\nthe ramp. It came, a twitter, a coo, a subdued roar that seemed trying to tell\nme something, give me some message. I stopped, looking around me; the\ngirders marched off rhythmically into the dark, over the cobblestones the red\nlights shone. Then I was beneath the bridge and it was as though they had\nbeen waiting for me and no one but me -- dedicated and set aside for me --\nfor an eternity. And I looked above toward the sound, my mind forming an\nimage of wings, as something struck my face and streaked, and I could smell\nthe foul air now, and see the encrusted barrage, feeling it streak my jacket\nand raising my brief case above my head and running, hearing it splattering\naround, falling like rain. I ran the gantlet, thinking, even the birds; even the\npigeons and the sparrows and the goddam gulls! I ran blindly, boiling with\noutrage and despair and harsh laughter. Running from the birds to what, I\ndidn\'t know. I ran. Why was I here at all?\nI ran through the night, ran within myself. Ran.\nChapter 25\nWhen I reached Morningside the shooting sounded like a distant\ncelebration of the Fourth of July, and I hurried forward. At St. Nicholas the\nstreet lights were out. A thunderous sound arose and I saw four men running\ntoward me pushing something that jarred the walk. It was a safe.\n"Say," I began.\n"Get the hell out the way!"\nI leaped aside, into the street, and there was a sudden and brilliant\nsuspension of time, like the interval between the last ax stroke and the felling\nof a tall tree, in which there had been a loud noise followed by a loud\nsilence. Then I was aware of figures crouching in doorways and along the\ncurb; then time burst and I was down in the street, conscious but unable to\nrise, struggling against the street and seeing the flashes as the guns went off\nback at the corner of the avenue, aware to my left of the men still speeding\nthe rumbling safe along the walk as back up the street, behind me, two\npolicemen, almost invisible in black shirts, thrust flaming pistols before them.\nOne of the safe rollers pitched forward, and farther away, past the corner, a\nbullet struck an auto tire, the released air shrieking like a huge animal in\nagony. I rolled, flopping around, willing myself to crawl closer to the curb but\nunable, feeling a sudden wet warmth upon my face and seeing the safe\nshooting wildly into the intersection and the men rounding the corner into\nthe dark, pounding, gone; gone now, as the skittering safe bounded off at a\ntangent, shot into the intersection and lodged in the third rail and sent up a\ncurtain of sparks that lit up the block like a blue dream; a dream I was\ndreaming and through which I could see the cops braced as on a target\nrange, feet forward, free arms akimbo, firing with deliberate aim.\n"Get hold of Emergency!" one of them called, and I saw them turn\nand disappear where the dull glint of trolley rails faded off into the dark.\nSuddenly the block leaped alive. Men who seemed to rise up out of\nthe sidewalks were rushing into the store fronts above me, their voices rising\nexcitedly. And now the blood was in my face and I could move, getting to\nmy knees as someone out of the crowd was helping me to stand.\n"You hurt, daddy?"\n"Some -- I don\'t know --" I couldn\'t quite see them.\n"Damn! He\'s got a hole in his head!" a voice said.\nA light flashed in my face, came close. I felt a hard hand upon my\nskull and moved away.\n"Hell, it\'s just a nick," a voice said. "One them forty-fives hit your\nlittle finger you got to go down!"\n"Well, this one over here is gone down for the last time," someone\ncalled from the walk. "They got him clean."\nI wiped my face, my head ringing. Something was missing.\n"Here, buddy, this yours?"\nIt was my brief case, extended to me by its handles. I seized it with\nsudden panic, as though something infinitely precious had almost been lost to\nme.\n"Thanks," I said, peering into their dim, blue-tinted features. I looked\nat the dead man. He lay face forward, the crowd working around him. I\nrealized suddenly that it might have been me huddled there, feeling too that I\nhad seen him there before, in the bright light of noon, long ago . . . how\nlong? Knew his name, I thought, and suddenly my knees flowed forward. I\nsat there, my fist that gripped the brief case bruising against the street, my\nhead slumped forward. They were going around me.\n"Get off my foot, man," I heard. "Quit shoving. There\'s plenty for\neverybody."\nThere was something I had to do and I knew that my forgetfulness\nwasn\'t real, as one knows that the forgotten details of certain dreams are not\ntruly forgotten but evaded. I knew, and in my mind I was trying to reach\nthrough the gray veil that now seemed to hang behind my eyes as opaquely\nas the blue curtain that screened the street beyond the safe. The dizziness left\nand I managed to stand, holding onto my brief case, pressing a handkerchief\nto my head. Up the street there sounded the crashing of huge sheets of glass\nand through the blue mysteriousness of the dark the walks shimmered like\nshattered mirrors. All the street\'s signs were dead, all the day sounds had lost\ntheir stable meaning. Somewhere a burglar alarm went off, a meaningless\nblangy sound, followed by the joyful shouts of looters.\n"Come on," someone called nearby.\n"Let\'s go, buddy," the man who had helped me said. He took my\narm, a thin man who carried a large cloth bag slung over his shoulder.\n"The shape you in wouldn\'t do to leave you round here," he said.\n"You act like you drunk."\n"Go where?" I said.\n"Where? Hell, man. Everywhere. We git to moving, no telling where\nwe might go -- Hey, Dupre!" he called.\n"Say, man -- Goddam! Don\'t be calling my name so loud," a voice\nanswered. "Here, I am over here, gitting me some work shirts."\n"Git some for me, Du," he said.\n"All right, but don\'t think I\'m your papa," the answer came.\nI looked at the thin man, feeling a surge of friendship. He didn\'t\nknow me, his help was disinterested . . .\n"Hey, Du," he called, "we go\'n do it?"\n"Hell yes, soon as I git me these shirts."\nThe crowd was working in and out of the stores like ants around\nspilled sugar. From time to time there came the crash of glass, shots; fire\ntrucks in distant streets.\n"How you feel?" the man said.\n"Still fuzzy," I said, "and weak."\n"Le\'s see if it\'s stopped bleeding. Yeah, you\'ll be all right."\nI saw him vaguely though his voice came clear.\n"Sure," I said.\n"Man, you lucky you ain\'t dead. These sonsabitches is really shooting\nnow," he said. "Over on Lenox they was aiming up in the air. If I could find\nme a rifle, I\'d show \'em! Here, take you a drink of this good Scotch," he\nsaid, taking a quart bottle from a hip pocket. "I got me a whole case stashed\nwhat I got from a liquor store over there. Over there all you got to do is\nbreathe, and you drunk, man. Drunk! Hundred proof bonded whiskey flowing\nall in the gutters."\nI took a drink, shuddering as the whiskey went down but thankful\nfor the shock it gave me. There was a bursting, tearing movement of people\naround me, dark figures in a blue glow.\n"Look at them take it away," he said, looking into the dark action of\nthe crowd. "Me, I\'m tired. Was you over on Lenox?"\n"No," I said, seeing a woman moving slowly past with a row of about\na dozen dressed chickens suspended by their necks from the handle of a new\nstraw broom . . .\n"Hell, you ought to see it, man. Everything is tore up. By now the\nwomens is picking it clean. I saw one ole woman with a whole side of a cow\non her back. Man, she was \'bout bent bowlegged trying to make it home --\nHere come Dupre now," he said, breaking off.\nI saw a little hard man come out of the crowd carrying several\nboxes. He wore three hats upon his head, and several pairs of suspenders\nflopped about his shoulders, and now as he came toward us I saw that he\nwore a pair of gleaming new rubber hip boots. His pockets bulged and over\nhis shoulder he carried a cloth sack that swung heavily behind him.\n"Damn, Dupre," my friend said, pointing to his head, "you got one of\nthem for me? What kind is they?"\nDupre stopped and looked at him. "With all them hats in there and\nI\'m going to come out with anything but a Dobbs? Man, are you mad? All\nthem new, pretty-colored Dobbs? Come on, let\'s get going before the cops git\nback. Damn, look at that thing blaze!"\nI looked toward the curtain of blue fire, through which vague figures\ntoiled. Dupre called out and several men left the crowd and joined us in the\nstreet. We moved off, my friend (Scofield, the others called him) leading me\nalong. My head throbbed, still bled.\n"Looks like you got you some loot too," he said, pointing to my brief\ncase.\n"Not much," I said, thinking, loot? Loot? And suddenly I knew why\nit was heavy, remembering Mary\'s broken bank and the coins; and now I\nfound myself opening the brief case and dropping all my papers -- my\nBrotherhood identification, the anonymous letter, along with Clifton\'s doll --\ninto it.\n"Fill it up, man. Don\'t you be bashful. You wait till we tackle one of\nthese pawnshops. That Du\'s got him a cotton-picking sack fulla stuff. He\ncould go into business."\n"Well, I\'ll be damn," a man on the other side of me said. "I thought\nthat was a cotton sack. Where\'d he get that thing?"\n"He brought it with him when he come North," Scofield said. "Du\nswears that when he goes back he\'ll have it full of ten-dollar bills. Hell, after\ntonight he\'ll need him a warehouse for all the stuff he\'s got. You fill that\nbrief case, buddy. Get yourself something!"\n"No," I said, "I\'ve enough in it already." And now I remembered very\nclearly where I\'d started out for but could not leave them.\n"Maybe you right," Scofield said. "How I know, you might have it full\nof diamonds or something. A man oughtn\'t to be greedy. Though it\'s time\nsomething like this happened."\nWe moved along. Should I leave, get on to the district? Where were\nthey, at the birthday celebration?\n"How did all this get started?" I said.\nScofield seemed surprised. "Damn if I know, man. A cop shot a\nwoman or something."\nAnother man moved close to us as somewhere a piece of heavy steel\nrang down.\n"Hell, that wasn\'t what started it," he said. "It was that fellow, what\'s\nhis name . . . ?"\n"Who?" I said. "What\'s his name?"\n"That young guy!"\n"You know, everybody\'s mad about it . . ."\nClifton, I thought. It\'s for Clifton. A night for Clifton.\n"Aw man, don\'t tell me," Scofield said. "Didn\'t I see it with my own\neyes? About eight o\'clock down on Lenox and 123rd this paddy slapped a kid\nfor grabbing a Baby Ruth and the kid\'s mama took it up and then the paddy\nslapped her and that\'s when hell broke loose."\n"You were there?" I said.\n"Same\'s I\'m here. Some fellow said the kid made the paddy mad by\ngrabbing a candy named after a white woman."\n"Damn if that\'s the way I heard it," another man said. "When I come\nup they said a white woman set it oft by trying to take a black gal\'s man."\n"Damn who started it," Dupre said. "All I want is for it to last a\nwhile."\n"It was a white gal, all right, but that wasn\'t the way it was. She was\ndrunk --" another voice said.\nBut it couldn\'t have been Sybil, I thought; it had already started.\n"You wahn know who started it?" a man holding a pair of binoculars\ncalled from the window of a pawnshop. "You wahn really to know?"\n"Sure," I said.\n"Well, you don\'t need to go no further. It was started by that great\nleader, Ras the Destroyer!"\n"That monkey-chaser?" someone said.\n"Listen, bahstard!"\n"Don\'t nobody know how it started," Dupre said.\n"Somebody has to know," I said.\nScofield held his whiskey toward me. I refused it.\n"Hell, man, it just exploded. These is dog days," he said.\n"Dog days?"\n"Sho, this hot weather."\n"I tell you they mad over what happen to that young fellow,\nwhat\'s-his-name . . ."\nWe were passing a building now and I heard a voice calling\nfrantically, "Colored store! Colored store!"\n"Then put up a sign, motherfouler," a voice said. "You probably\nrotten as the others."\n"Listen at the bastard. For one time in his life he\'s glad to be\ncolored," Scofield said.\n"Colored store," the voice went on automatically.\n"Hey! You sho you ain\'t got some white blood?"\n"No, sir!" the voice said.\n"Should I bust him, man?"\n"For what? He ain\'t got a damn thing. Let the motherfouler alone."\nA few doors away we came to a hardware store. "This is the first\nstop, men," Dupre said.\n"What happens now?" I said.\n"Who you?" he said, cocking his thrice-hatted head.\n"Nobody, just one of the boys --" I began.\n"You sho you ain\'t somebody I know?"\n"I\'m pretty sure," I said.\n"He\'s all right, Du," said Scofield. "Them cops shot him."\nDupre looked at me and kicked something -- a pound of butter,\nsending it smearing across the hot street. "We fixing to do something what\nneeds to be done," he said. "First we gets a flashlight for everybody . . . And\nlet\'s have some organization, y\'all. Don\'t everybody be running over everybody\nelse. Come on!"\n"Come on in, buddy," Scofield said.\nI felt no need to lead or leave them; was glad to follow; was gripped\nby a need to see where and to what they would lead. And all the time the\nthought that I should go to the district was with me. We went inside the\nstore, into the dark glinting with metal. They moved carefully, and I could\nhear them searching, sweeping objects to the floor. The cash register rang.\n"Here some flashlights over here," someone called.\n"How many?" Dupre said.\n"Plenty, man."\n"Okay, pass out one to everybody. They got batteries?"\n"Naw, but there\'s plenty them too, \'bout a dozen boxes."\n"Okay, give me one with batteries so I can find the buckets. Then\nevery man get him a light."\n"Here some buckets over here," Scofield said.\n"Then all we got to find is where he keeps the oil."\n"Oil?" I said.\n"Coal oil, man. And hey, y\'all," he called, \'"don\'t nobody be smoking\nin here."\nI stood beside Scofield listening to the noise as he took a stack of\nzinc buckets and passed them out. Now the store leaped alive with flashing\nlights and flickering shadows.\n"Keep them lights down on the floor," Dupre called. "No use letting\nfolks see who we are. Now when you get your buckets line up and let me fill\n\'em."\n"Listen to ole Du lay it down -- he\'s a bitch, ain\'t he, buddy? He\nalways liked to lead things. And always leading me into trouble."\n"What are we getting ready to do?" I said.\n"You\'ll see," Dupre said. "Hey, you over there. Come on from behind\nthat counter and take this bucket. Don\'t you see ain\'t nothing in that cash\nregister, that if it was I\'d have it myself?"\nSuddenly the banging of buckets ceased. We moved into the back\nroom. By the light of a flash I could see a row of fuel drums mounted on\nracks. Dupre stood before them in his new hip boots and filled each bucket\nwith oil. We moved in slow order. Our buckets filled, we filed out into the\nstreet. I stood there in the dark feeling a rising excitement as their voices\nplayed around me. What was the meaning of it all? What should I think of\nit, do about it?\n"With this stuff," Dupre said, "we better walk in the middle of the\nstreet. It\'s just down around the corner."\nThen as we moved off a group of boys ran among us and the men\nstarted using their lights, revealing darting figures in blonde wigs, the tails of\ntheir stolen dress coats flying. Behind them in hot pursuit came a gang\narmed with dummy rifles taken from an Army & Navy Store. I laughed with\nthe others, thinking: A holy holiday for Clifton.\n"Put out them lights!" Dupre commanded.\nBehind us came the sound of screams, laughter; ahead the footfalls of\nthe running boys, distant fire trucks, shooting, and in the quiet intervals, the\nsteady filtering of shattered glass. I could smell the kerosene as it sloshed\nfrom the buckets and slapped against the street.\nSuddenly Scofield grabbed my arm. "Good God, look-a-yonder!"\nAnd I saw a crowd of men running up pulling a Borden\'s milk\nwagon, on top of which, surrounded by a row of railroad flares, a huge\nwoman in a gingham pinafore sat drinking beer from a barrel which sat\nbefore her. The men would run furiously a few paces and stop, resting\nbetween the shafts, run a few paces and rest, shouting and laughing and\ndrinking from a jug, as she on top threw back her head and shouted\npassionately in a full-throated voice of blues singer\'s timbre:\nIf it hadn\'t been for the referee,\nJoe Louis woulda killed\nJim Jefferie\nFree beer!!\n-- sloshing the dipper of beer around.\nWe stepped aside, amazed, as she bowed graciously from side to side\nlike a tipsy fat lady in a circus parade, the dipper like a gravy spoon in her\nenormous hand. Then she laughed and drank deeply while reaching over\nnonchalantly with her free hand to send quart after quart ot milk crashing\ninto the street. And all the time the men running with the wagon over the\ndebris. Around me there were shouts of laughter and disapproval.\n"Somebody better stop them fools," Scofield said in outrage. "That\'s\nwhat I call taking things too far. Goddam, how the hell they going to get her\ndown from there after she gits fulla beer? Somebody answer me that. How\nthey going to get her down? \'Round here throwing away all that good milk!"\nThe big woman left me unnerved. Milk and beer -- I felt sad,\nwatching the wagon careen dangerously as they went around a corner. We\nwent on, avoiding the broken bottles as now the spilling kerosene splashed\ninto the pale spilt milk. How much has happened? Why was I torn? We\nmoved around a corner. My head still ached.\nScofield touched my arm. "Here we is," he said.\nWe had come to a huge tenement building.\n"Where are we?" I said.\n"This the place where most of us live," he said. "Come on."\nSo that was it, the meaning of the kerosene. I couldn\'t believe it,\ncouldn\'t believe they had the nerve. All the windows seemed empty. They\'d\nblacked it out themselves. I saw now only by flash or flame.\n"Where will you live?" I said, looking up, up.\n"You call this living?" Scofield said. "It\'s the only way to git rid of it,\nman . . ."\nI looked for hesitation in their vague forms. They stood looking at\nthe building rising above us, the liquid dark of the oil simmering dully in the\nstray flecks of light that struck their pails, bent forward, their shoulders\nbowed. None said "no," by word or stance. And in the dark windows and on\nthe roofs above I could now discern the forms of women and children.\nDupre moved toward the building.\n"Now look ahere, y\'all," he said, his triple-hatted head showing\ngrotesquely atop the stoop. "I wants all the women and chillun and the old\nand the sick folks brought out. And when you takes your buckets up the\nstairs I wants you to go clean to the top. I mean the top! And when you git\nthere I want you to start using your flashlights in every room to make sure\nnobody gits left behind, then when you git \'em out start splashing coal oil.\nThen when you git it splashed I\'m going to holler, and when I holler three\ntimes I want you to light them matches and git. After that it\'s every tub on\nits own black bottom!"\nIt didn\'t occur to me to interfere, or to question . . . They had a\nplan. Already I could see the women and children coming down the steps. A\nchild was crying. And suddenly everyone paused, turning, looking off into the\ndark. Somewhere nearby an incongruous sound shook the dark, an air\nhammer pounding like a machine gun. They paused with the sensitivity of\ngrazing deer, then returned to their work, the women and children once more\nmoving.\n"That\'s right, y\'all. You ladies move on up the street to the folks you\ngoing to stay with," Dupre said. "And keep holt them kids!"\nSomeone pounded my back and I swung around, seeing a woman\npush past me and climb up to catch Dupre\'s arm, their two figures seeming\nto blend as her voice arose, thin, vibrant and desperate.\n"Please, Dupre," she said, "please. You know my time\'s almost here .\n. . you know it is. If you do it now, where am I going to go?"\nDupre pulled away and rose to a higher step. He looked down at\nher, shaking his thrice-hatted head. "Now git on out the way, Lottie," he said\npatiently. "Why you have to start this now? We done been all over it and\nyou know I ain\'t go\'n change. And lissen here, the resta y\'all," he said,\nreaching into the top of his hip boot and producing a nickel-plated revolver\nand waving it around, "don\'t think they\'s going to be any mind-changing\neither. And I don\'t aim for no arguments neither."\n"You goddam right, Dupre. We wid you!"\n"My kid died from the t-bees in that deathtrap, but I bet a man ain\'t\nno more go\'n be born in there," he said. "So now, Lottie, you go on up the\nstreet and let us mens git going."\nShe stood back, crying. I looked at her, in house shoes, her breasts\nturgid, her belly heavy and high. In the crowd, women\'s hands took her away,\nher large liquid eyes turned for a second toward the man in the rubber\nboots.\nWhat type of man is he, what would Jack say of him? Jack. Jack!\nAnd where was he in this?\n"Let\'s go, buddy," Scofield said, nudging me. I followed him, filled\nwith a sense of Jack\'s outrageous unreality. We went in, up the stairs,\nflashing our lights. Ahead I saw Dupre moving. He was a type of man\nnothing in my life had taught me to see, to understand, or respect, a man\noutside the scheme till now. We entered rooms littered with the signs of swift\nemptying. It was hot, close.\n"This here\'s my own apartment," Scofield said. "And ain\'t the bedbugs\ngoing to get a surprise!"\nWe slopped the kerosene about, upon an old mattress, along the\nfloor; then moved into the hall, using the flashlights. From all through the\nbuilding came the sounds of footsteps, of splashing oil, the occasional\nprayerful protest of some old one being forced to leave. The men worked in\nsilence now, like moles deep in the earth. Time seemed to hold. No one\nlaughed. Then from below came Dupre\'s\' voice.\n"Okay, mens. We got everybody out. Now starting with the top floor\nI want you to start striking matches. Be careful and don\'t set yourself on fire\n. . ."\nThere was still some kerosene left in Scofield\'s bucket and I saw him\npick up a rag and drop it in; then came the sputtering of a match and I saw\nthe room leap to flame. The heat flared up and I backed away. He stood\nthere silhouetted against the red flare, looking into the flames, shouting.\n"Goddam you rotten sonsabitches. You didn\'t think I\'d do it but there\nit is. You wouldn\'t fix it up. Now see how you like it."\n"Let\'s go," I said.\nBelow us, men shot downstairs five and six steps at a time, moving\nin the weird light of flash and flame in long, dream-bounds. On each floor as\nI passed, smoke and flame arose. And now I was seized with a fierce sense\nof exaltation. They\'ve done it, I thought. They organized it and carried it\nthrough alone; the decision their own and their own action. Capable of their\nown action . . .\nThere came a thunder of footfalls above me, someone calling, "Keep\ngoing man, it\'s hell upstairs. Somebody done opened the door to the roof and\nthem flames is leaping."\n"Come on," Scofield said.\nI moved, feeling something slip and was halfway down the next flight\nbefore realizing that my brief case was gone. For a second I hesitated, but I\'d\nhad it too long to leave it now.\n"Come on, buddy," Scofield called, "we caint be fooling around."\n"In a second," I said.\nMen were shooting past. I bent over, holding on to the handrail and\nshouldered my way back up the stairs, using my flash along each step, back\nslowly, finding it, an oily footstep embedded with crushed pieces of plaster\nshowing upon its leather side; getting it now and turning to bound down\nagain. The oil won\'t come off easily, I thought with a pang. But this was it,\nwhat I had known was coming around the dark corner of my mind, had\nknown and tried to tell the committee and which they had ignored. I plunged\ndown, shaking with fierce excitement.\nAt the landing I saw a bucket half full of kerosene and seized it,\nflinging it impulsively into a burning room. A huge puff of smoke-fringed\nflame filled the doorway, licking outward toward me. I ran, choking and\ncoughing as I plunged. They did it themselves, I thought, holding my breath\n-- planned it, organized it, applied the flame.\nI burst into the air and the exploding sounds of the night, and I did\nnot know if the voice was that of a man, woman or child, but for a moment\nI stood on the stoop with the red doorway behind me and heard the voice\ncall me by my Brotherhood name.\nIt was as though I had been aroused from sleep and for an instant I\nstood there looking, listening to the voice almost lost in the clamour of\nshouts, screams, burglar alarms and sirens.\n"Brother, ain\'t it wonderful," it called. "You said you would lead us,\nyou really said it . . ."\nI went down into the street, going slowly but filled with a feverish\ninner need to be away from that voice. Where had Scofield gone?\nMost of their eyes, white in the flame-flushed dark, looked toward\nthe building.\nBut now I heard someone say, "Woman, who you say that is?" And\nshe proudly repeated my name.\n"Where he go? Get him, mahn, Ras wahnt him!"\nI went into the crowd, walking slowly, smoothly into the dark crowd,\nthe whole surface of my skin alert, my back chilled, looking, listening to\nthose moving with a heaving and sweating and a burr of talk around me and\naware that now that I wanted to see them, needed to see them, I could not;\nfeeling them, a dark mass in motion on a dark night, a black river ripping\nthrough a black land; and Ras or Tarp could move beside me and I wouldn\'t\nknow. I was one with the mass, moving down the littered street over the\npuddles of oil and milk, my personality blasted. Then I was in the next block,\ndodging in and out, hearing them somewhere in the crowd behind me;\nmoving on through the sound of sirens and burglar alarms to be swept into a\nswifter crowd and pushed along, half-running, half-walking, trying to see\nbehind me and wondering where the others had gone. There was shooting\nback there now, and on either side of me they were throwing garbage cans,\nbricks and pieces of metal into plate glass windows. I moved, feeling as\nthough a huge force was on the point of bursting. Shouldering my way to the\nside I stood in a doorway and watched them move, feeling a certain\nvindication as now I thought of the message that had brought me here. Who\nhad called, one of the district members or someone from Jack\'s birthday\ncelebration? Who wanted me at the district after it was too late? Very well,\nI\'d go there now. I\'d see what the master minds thought now. Where were\nthey anyway, and what profound conclusions were they drawing? What ex\npost facto lessons of history? And that crash over the telephone, had that\nbeen the beginning, or had Jack simply dropped his eye? I laughed\ndrunkenly, the eruption paining my head.\nSuddenly the shooting ceased and in the silence there was the sound\nof voices, footfalls, labor.\n"Hey, buddy," somebody said beside me, "where you going?" It was\nScofield.\n"It\'s either run or get knocked down," I said. "I thought you were\nstill back there."\n"I cut out, man. A building two doors away started to burn and they\nhad to git the fire department . . . Damn! wasn\'t for this noise I\'d swear\nthose bullets was mosquitoes."\n"Watch out!" I warned, pulling him away from where a man lay\npropped against a post, tightening a tourniquet around his gashed arm.\nScofield flashed his light and for a second I saw the black man, his\nface gray with shock, watching the jetting pulsing of his blood spurting into\nthe street. Then, compelled, I reached down and twisted the tourniquet,\nfeeling the blood warm upon my hand, seeing the pulsing cease.\n"You done stopped it," a young man said, looking down.\n"Here," I said, "you take it, hold it tight. Get him to a doctor."\n"Ain\'t you a doctor?"\n"Me?" I said. "Me? Are you crazy? If you want him to live, get him\naway from here."\n"Albert done gone for one," the boy said. "But I thought you was\none. You --"\n"No," I said, looking at my bloody hands, "no, not me. You hold it\ntight until the doctor comes. I couldn\'t cure a headache."\nI stood wiping my hands against the brief case, looking down at the\nbig man, his back resting against the post with his eyes closed, the boy\nholding desperately to the tourniquet made of what had been a bright new\ntie.\n"Come on," I said.\n"Say," Scofield said when we were past, "wasn\'t that you that woman\nwas calling brother back yonder?"\n"Brother? No, it must have been some other guy."\n"You know, man, I think I seen you before somewhere. You ever was\nin Memphis . . . ? Say, look what\'s coming," he said, pointing, and I looked\nthrough the dark to see a squad of white-helmeted policemen charge forward\nand break for shelter as a rain of bricks showered down from the building\ntops. Some of the white helmets, racing for the doorways, turned to fire, and\nI heard Scofield grunt and go down and I dropped beside him, seeing the red\nburst of fire and hearing the shrill scream, like an arching dive, curving from\nabove to end in a crunching thud in the street. It was as though it landed in\nmy stomach, sickening me, and I crouched, looking down past Scofield, who\nlay just ahead of me, to see the dark crushed form from the roof; and farther\naway, the body of a cop, his helmet making a small white luminous mound\nin the dark.\nI moved now to see whether Scofield was hit, just as he squirmed\naround and cursed at the cops who were trying to rescue the one who was\ndown, his voice furious, as he stretched full length firing away with a\nnickel-plated pistol like that Dupre had waved.\n"Git the hell down, man," he yelled over his shoulder. "I been\nwanting to blast \'em a long time."\n"No, not with that thing," I said. "Let\'s get out of here."\n"Hell, man, I can shoot this thing," he said.\nI rolled behind a pile of baskets filled with rotting chickens now, and\nto my left, upon the littered curb, a woman and man crouched behind an\nupturned delivery cart.\n"Dehart," she said, "let\'s get up on the hill, Dehart. Up with the\nrespectable people!"\n"Hill, hell! We stay right here," the man said. "This thing\'s just\nstarting. If it becomes a sho \'nough race riot I want to be here where there\'ll\nbe some fighting back."\nThe words struck like bullets fired close range, blasting my\nsatisfaction to earth. It was as though the uttered word had given meaning to\nthe night, almost as though it had created it, brought it into being in the\ninstant his breath vibrated small against the loud, riotous air. And in\ndefining, in giving organization to the fury, it seemed to spin me around, and\nin my mind I was looking backward over the days since Clifton\'s death . . .\nCould this be the answer, could this be what the committee had planned, the\nanswer to why they\'d surrendered our influence to Ras? Suddenly I heard the\nhoarse explosion of a shotgun, and looked past Scofield\'s glinting pistol to the\nhuddled form from the roof. It was suicide, without guns it was suicide, and\nnot even the pawnshops here had guns for sale; and yet I knew with a\nshattering dread that the uproar which for the moment marked primarily the\ncrash of men against things -- against stores, markets -- could swiftly become\nthe crash of men against men and with most of the guns and numbers on\nthe other side. I could see it now, see it clearly and in growing magnitude. It\nwas not suicide, but murder. The committee had planned it. And I had\nhelped, had been a tool. A tool just at the very moment I had thought myself\nfree. By pretending to agree I had indeed agreed, had made myself\nresponsible for that huddled form lighted by flame and gunfire in the street,\nand all the others whom now the night was making ripe for death.\nThe brief case swung heavy against my leg as I ran, going away,\nleaving Scofield cursing his lack of bullets behind me, running wildly and\nswinging the brief case hard against the head of a dog that leaped at me out\nof the crowd, sending him yelping away. To my right lay a quiet residential\nstreet with trees, and I entered it, going toward Seventh Avenue, toward the\ndistrict, filled now with horror and hatred. They\'ll pay, they\'ll pay, I thought.\nThey\'ll pay!\nThe street lay dead quiet in the light of the lately risen moon, the\ngunfire thin and for a moment, distant. The rioting seemed in another world.\nFor a moment I paused beneath a low, thickly leaved tree, looking down the\nwell-kept doily-shadowed walks past the silent houses. It was as though the\ntenants had vanished, leaving the houses silent with all windows shaded,\nrefugees from a rising flood. Then I heard the single footfalls coming\ndoggedly toward me in the night, an eerie slapping sound followed by a\nprecise and hallucinated cry --\n"Time\'s flying\nSouls dying\nThe coming of the Lord\nDraweth niiiiigh!"\n-- as though he had run for days, for years. He trotted past where I stood\nbeneath the tree, his bare feet slapping the walk in the silence, going for a\nfew feet and then the high, hallucinated cry beginning again.\nI ran into the avenue where in the light of a flaming liquor store I\nsaw three old women scurrying toward me with raised skirts loaded with\ncanned goods.\n"I can\'t stop it just yet, but have mercy, Lord," one of them said.\n"Do, Jesus, do, sweet Jesus . . ."\nI moved ahead, the fumes of alcohol and burning tar in my nostrils.\nDown the avenue to my left a single street lamp still glowed where the long\nblock was intersected on my right by a street, and I could see a crowd\nrushing a store that faced the intersection, moving in, and a fusillade of\ncanned goods, salami, liverwurst, hogsheads and chitterlings belching out to\nthose outside and a bag of flour bursting white upon them; as now out of\nthe dark of the intersecting street two mounted policemen came at a gallop,\nheaving huge and heavy-hooved, charging straight into the swarming mass.\nAnd I could see the great forward lunge of the horses and the crowd\nbreaking and rolling back like a wave, back, and screaming and cursing, and\nsome laughing -- back and around and out into the avenue, stumbling and\npushing, as the horses, heads high and bits froth-flecked, went over the curb\nto land stiff-legged and slide over the cleared walk as upon ice skates and\npast, carried by the force of the charge, sideways now, legs stiff, sparks flying,\nto where another crowd looted another store. And my heart tightened as the\nfirst crowd swung imperturbably back to their looting with derisive cries, like\nsandpipers swinging around to glean the shore after a furious wave\'s\nrecession.\nCursing Jack and the Brotherhood I moved around a steel grill torn\nfrom the front of a pawnshop, seeing the troopers galloping back and the\nriders lifting the horses to charge again, grim and skillful in white steel\nhelmets, and the charge beginning. This time a man went down and I saw a\nwoman swinging a gleaming frying pan hard against the horse\'s rump and the\nhorse neighing and beginning to plunge. They\'ll pay, I thought, they\'ll pay.\nThey came toward me as I ran, a crowd of men and women carrying cases of\nbeer, cheese, chains of linked sausage, watermelons, sacks of sugar, hams,\ncornmeal, fuel lamps. If only it could stop right here, here; here before the\nothers came with their guns. I ran.\nThere was no firing. But when, I thought, how long before it starts?\n"Git a side of bacon, Joe," a woman called. "Git a side of bacon, Joe,\ngit Wilson\'s."\n"Lord, Lord, Lord," a dark voice called from the dark.\nI went on, plunged in a sense of painful isolation as I reached 125th\nStreet and started east. A squad of mounted police galloped past. Men with\nsub-machine guns were guarding a bank and a large jewelry store. I moved\nout to the center of the street, running down the trolley rails.\nThe moon was high now and before me the shattered glass glittered\nin the street like the water of a flooded river upon the surface of which I ran\nas in a dream, avoiding by fate alone the distorted objects washed away by\nthe flood. Then suddenly I seemed to sink, sucked under: Ahead of me the\nbody hung, white, naked, and horribly feminine from a lamppost. I felt myself\nspin around with horror and it was as though I had turned some nightmarish\nsomersault. I whirled, still moving by reflex, back-tracking and stopped and\nnow there was another and another, seven-all hanging before a gutted\nstorefront. I stumbled, hearing the cracking of bones underfoot and saw a\nphysician\'s skeleton shattered on the street, the skull rolling away from the\nbackbone, as I steadied long enough to notice the unnatural stiffness of those\nhanging above me. They were mannequins -- "Dummies!" I said aloud.\nHairless, bald and sterilely feminine. And I recalled the boys in the blonde\nwigs, expecting the relief of laughter, but suddenly was more devastated by\nthe humor than by the horror. But are they unreal, I thought; are they? What\nif one, even one is real -- is . . . Sybil? I hugged my brief case, backing\naway, and ran . . .\nTHEY moved in a tight-knit order, carrying sticks and clubs, shotguns\nand rifles, led by Ras the Exhorter become Ras the Destroyer upon a great\nblack horse. A new Ras of a haughty, vulgar dignity, dressed in the costume\nof an Abyssinian chieftain; a fur cap upon his head, his arm bearing a shield,\na cape made of the skin of some wild animal around his shoulders. A figure\nmore out of a dream than out of Harlem, than out of even this Harlem\nnight, yet real, alive, alarming.\n"Come away from that stupid looting," he called to a group before a\nstore. "Come jine with us to burst in the armory and get guns and\nammunition!"\nAnd hearing his voice I opened my brief case and searched for my\ndark glasses, my Rineharts, drawing them out only to see the crushed lenses\nfall to the street. Rinehart, I thought, Rinehart! I turned. The police were\nback there behind me; if shooting started I\'d be caught in the crossfire. I felt\nin my brief case, feeling papers, shattered iron, coins, my fingers closing over\nTarp\'s leg chain, and I slipped it over my knuckles, trying to think. I closed\nthe flap, locking it. A new mood was settling over me as they came on, a\nlarger crowd than Ras had ever drawn. I went calmly forward, holding the\nheavy case but moving with a certain new sense of self, and with it a feeling\nalmost of relief, almost of a sigh. I knew suddenly what I had to do, knew it\neven before it shaped itself completely in my mind.\nSomeone called, "Look!" and Ras bent down from the horse, saw me\nand flung, of all things, a spear, and I fell forward at the movement of his\narm, catching myself upon my hands as a tumbler would, and heard the\nshock of it piercing one of the hanging dummies. I stood, my brief case\ncoming with me.\n"Betrayer!" Ras shouted.\n"It\'s the brother," someone said. They moved up around the horse\nexcited and not quite decided, and I faced him, knowing I was no worse than\nhe, nor any better, and that all the months of illusion and the night of chaos\nrequired but a few simple words, a mild, even a meek, muted action to clear\nthe air. To awaken them and me.\n"I am no longer their brother," I shouted. "They want a race riot and\nI am against it. The more of us who are killed, the better they like --"\n"Ignore his lying tongue," Ras shouted. "Hang him up to teach the\nblack people a lesson, and theer be no more traitors. No more Uncle Toms.\nHang him up theer with them blahsted dummies!"\n"But anyone can see it," I shouted. "It\'s true, I was betrayed by those\nwho I thought were our friends -- but they counted on this man, too. They\nneeded this destroyer to do their work. They deserted you so that in your\ndespair you\'d follow this man to your destruction. Can\'t you see it? They\nwant you guilty of your own murder, your own sacrifice!"\n"Grab him!" Ras shouted.\nThree men stepped forward and I reached up without thinking,\nactually a desperate oratorical gesture of disagreement and defiance, as I\nshouted, "No!" But my hand struck the spear and I wrenched it free, gripping\nit mid-shaft, point forward. "They want this to happen," I said. "They planned\nit. They want the mobs to come uptown with machine guns and rifles. They\nwant the streets to flow with blood; your blood, black blood and white blood,\nso that they can turn your death and sorrow and defeat into propaganda. It\'s\nsimple, you\'ve known it a long time. It goes, \'Use a nigger to catch a nigger.\'\nWell, they used me to catch you and now they\'re using Ras to do away with\nme and to prepare your sacrifice. Don\'t you see it? Isn\'t it clear . . . ?"\n"Hang the lying traitor," Ras shouted. "What are you waiting for?"\nI saw a group of men start forward.\n"Wait," I said. "Then kill me for myself, for my own mistake, then\nleave it there. Don\'t kill me for those who are downtown laughing at the trick\nthey played --"\nBut even as I spoke I knew it was no good. I had no words and no\neloquence, and when Ras thundered, "Hang him!" I stood there facing them,\nand it seemed unreal. I faced them knowing that the madman in a foreign\ncostume was real and yet unreal, knowing that he wanted my life, that he\nheld me responsible for all the nights and days and all the suffering and for\nall that which I was incapable of controlling, and I no hero, but short and\ndark with only a certain eloquence and a bottomless capacity for being a fool\nto mark me from the rest; saw them, recognized them at last as those whom\nI had failed and of whom I was now, just now, a leader, though leading\nthem, running ahead of them, only in the stripping away of my illusionment.\nI looked at Ras on his horse and at their handful of guns and\nrecognized the absurdity of the whole night and of the simple yet\nconfoundingly complex arrangement of hope and desire, fear and hate, that\nhad brought me here still running, and knowing now who I was and where I\nwas and knowing too that I had no longer to run for or from the Jacks and\nthe Emersons and the Bledsoes and Nortons, but only from their confusion,\nimpatience, and refusal to recognize the beautiful absurdity of their American\nidentity and mine. I stood there, knowing that by dying, that by being hanged\nby Ras on this street in this destructive night I would perhaps move them\none fraction of a bloody step closer to a definition of who they were and of\nwhat I was and had been. But the definition would have been too narrow; I\nwas invisible, and hanging would not bring me to visibility, even to their\neyes, since they wanted my death not for myself alone but for the chase I\'d\nbeen on all my life; because of the way I\'d run, been run, chased, operated,\npurged -- although to a great extent I could have done nothing else, given\ntheir blindness (didn\'t they tolerate both Rinehart and Bledsoe?) and my\ninvisibility. And that I, a little black man with an assumed name should die\nbecause a big black man in his hatred and confusion over the nature of a\nreality that seemed controlled solely by white men whom I knew to be as\nblind as he, was just too much, too outrageously absurd. And I knew that it\nwas better to live out one\'s own absurdity than to die for that of others,\nwhether for Ras\'s or Jack\'s.\nSo when Ras yelled, "Hang him!" I let fly the spear and it was as\nthough for a moment I had surrendered my life and begun to live again,\nwatching it catch him as he turned his head to shout, ripping through both\ncheeks, and saw the surprised pause of the crowd as Ras wrestled with the\nspear that locked his jaws. Some of the men raised their guns, but they were\ntoo close to shoot and I hit the first with Tarp\'s leg chain and the other in\nthe middle with my brief case, then ran through a looted store, hearing the\nblanging of the burglar alarm as I scrambled over scattered shoes, upturned\nshowcases, chairs -- back to where I saw the moonlight through the rear door\nahead. They came behind me like a draft of flames and I led them through\nand around to the avenue, and if they\'d fired they could have had me, but it\nwas important to them that they hang me, lynch me even, since that was the\nway they ran, had been taught to run. I should die by hanging alone, as\nthough only hanging would settle things, even the score. So I ran expecting\ndeath between the shoulder blades or through the back of my head, and as I\nran I was trying to get to Mary\'s. It was not a decision of thought but\nsomething I realized suddenly while running over puddles of milk in the black\nstreet, stopping to swing the heavy brief case and the leg chain, slipping and\nsliding out of their hands.\nIf only I could turn around and drop my arms and say, "Look, men,\ngive me a break, we\'re all black folks together . . . Nobody cares." Though\nnow I knew we cared, they at last cared enough to act -- so I thought. If\nonly I could say, "Look, they\'ve played a trick on us, the same old trick with\nnew variations -- let\'s stop running and respect and love one another . . ." If\nonly -- I thought, running into another crowd now and thinking I\'d gotten\naway, only to catch a punch on my jaw as one closed in shouting, and\nfeeling the leg chain bounce as I caught his head and spurted forward,\nturning out of the avenue only to be struck by a spray of water that seemed\nto descend from above. It was a main that had burst, throwing a fierce\ncurtain of spray into the night. I was going for Mary\'s but I was moving\ndowntown through the dripping street rather than up, and, as I started\nthrough, a mounted policeman charged through the spray, the horse black\nand dripping, charging through and looming huge and unreal, neighing and\nclopping across the pavement upon me now as I slipped to my knees and\nsaw the huge pulsing bulk floating down upon and over me, the sound of\nhooves and screams and a rush of water coming through distantly as though\nI sat remote in a padded room, then over, almost past, the hair of the tail a\nfiery lash across my eyes. I stumbled about in circles, blindly swinging the\nbrief case, the image of a fiery comet\'s tail burning my smarting lids; turning\nand swinging blindly with brief case and leg chain and hearing the gallop\nbegin as I floundered helplessly; and now moving straight into the full, naked\nforce of the water, feeling its power like a blow, wet and thudding and cold,\nthen through it and able partly to see just as another horse dashed up and\nthrough, a hunter taking a barrier, the rider slanting backward, the horse\nrising, then hit and swallowed by the rising spray. I stumbled down the\nstreet, the comet tail in my eyes, seeing a little better now and looking back\nto see the water spraying like a mad geyser in the moonlight. To Mary, I\nthought, to Mary.\nTHERE were rows of iron fences backed by low hedges before the\nhouses and I stumbled behind them and lay panting to rest from the\ncrushing force of the water. But hardly had I settled down, the dry, dog-day\nsmell of the hedge in my nose, when they stopped before the house, leaning\nupon the fence. They were passing a bottle around and their voices sounded\nspent of strong emotion.\n"This is some night," one of them said. "Ain\'t this some night?"\n"It\'s \'bout like the rest."\n"Why you say that?"\n" \'Cause it\'s fulla fucking and fighting and drinking and lying --\ngimme that bottle."\n"Yeah, but tonight I seen some things I never seen before."\n"You think you seen something? Hell, you ought to been over on\nLenox about two hours ago. You know that stud Ras the Destroyer? Well,\nman, he was spitting blood."\n"That crazy guy?"\n"Hell, yes, man, he had him a big black hoss and a fur cap and\nsome kind of old lion skin or something over his shoulders and he was\nraising hell. Goddam if he wasn\'t a sight, riding up and down on this ole\nhoss, you know, one of the kind that pulls vegetable wagons, and he got him\na cowboy saddle and some big spurs."\n"Aw naw, man!"\n"Hell, yes! Riding up and down the block yelling, \'Destroy \'em! Drive\n\'em out! Burn \'em out! I, Ras, commands you.\' You get that, man," he said, "\n\'I, Ras, commands you -- to destroy them to the last piece of rotten fish!\'\nAnd \'bout that time some joker with a big ole Georgia voice sticks his head\nout the window and yells, \'Ride \'em, cowboy. Give \'em hell and bananas.\' And\nman, that crazy sonofabitch up there on that hoss looking like death eating a\nsandwich, he reaches down and comes up with a forty-five and starts blazing\nup at that window -- And man, talk about cutting out! In a second wasn\'t\nnobody left but ole Ras up there on that hoss with that lion skin stretched\nstraight out behind him. Crazy, man. Everybody else trying to git some loot\nand him and his boys out for blood!"\nI lay like a man rescued from drowning, listening, still not sure I\nwas alive.\n"I was over there," another voice said. "You see him when the\nmounted police got after his ass?"\n"Hell, naw . . . Here, take a li\'l taste."\n"Well that\'s when you shoulda seen him. When he seen them cops\nriding up he reached back of his saddle and come up with some kind of old\nshield."\n"A shield?"\n"Hell, yes! One with a spike in the middle of it. And that ain\'t all;\nwhen he sees the cops he calls to one of his goddam henchmens to hand\nhim up a spear, and a little short guy run out into the street and give him\none. You know, one of the kind you see them African guys carrying in the\nmoving pictures . . ."\n"Where the hell was you, man?"\n"Me? I\'m over on the side where some stud done broke in a store\nand is selling cold beer out the window -- Done gone into business, man,"\nthe voice laughed. "I was drinking me some Budweiser and digging the doings\n-- when here comes the cops up the street, riding like cowboys, man; and\nwhen ole Ras-the-what\'s-his-name sees \'em he lets out a roar like a lion and\nrears way back and starts shooting spurs into that boss\'s ass fast as nickels\nfalling in the subway at going-home time -- and gaawd-dam! that\'s when you\nought to seen him! Say, gimme a taste there, fella.\n"Thanks. Here he comes bookety-bookety with that spear stuck out in\nfront of him and that shield on his arm, charging, man. And he\'s yelling\nsomething in African or West Indian or something and he\'s got his head\ndown low like he knew about that shit too, man; riding like Earle Sande in\nthe fifth at Jamaica. That ole black hoss let out a whinny and got his head\ndown -- I don\'t know where he got that sonofabitch -- but, gentlemens, I\nswear! When he felt that steel in his high behind he came on like Man o\'\nWar going to get his ashes hauled! Before the cops knowed what hit \'em Ras\nis right in the middle of \'em and one cop grabbed for that spear, and ole\nRas swung \'round and bust him across the head and the cop goes down and\nhis hoss rears up, and ole Ras tries his and tries to spear him another cop,\nand the other hosses is plunging around and ole Ras tries to spear him still\nanother cop, only he\'s too close and the hoss is pooling and snorting and\npissing and shitting, and they swings around and the cop is swinging his\npistol and every time he swings ole Ras throws up his shield with one arm\nand chops at him with the spear with the other, and man, you could hear\nthat gun striking that ole shield like somebody dropping tire irons out a\ntwelve-story window. And you know what, when ole Ras saw he was too close\nto spear him a cop he wheeled that hoss around and rode off a bit and did\nhim a quick round-about face and charged \'em again -- out for blood, man!\nOnly this time the cops got tired of that bullshit and one of \'em started\nshooting. And that was the lick! Ole Ras didn\'t have time to git his gun so\nhe let fly with that spear and you could hear him grunt and say something\n\'bout that cop\'s kin-folks and then him and that hoss shot up the street\nleaping like Heigho, the goddam Silver!"\n"Man, where\'d you come from?"\n"It\'s the truth, man, here\'s my right hand."\nThey were laughing outside the hedge and leaving and I lay in a\ncramp, wanting to laugh and yet knowing that Ras was not funny, or not\nonly funny, but dangerous as well, wrong but justified, crazy and yet coldly\nsane . . . Why did they make it seem funny, only funny? I thought. And yet\nknowing that it was. It was funny and dangerous and sad. Jack had seen it,\nor had stumbled upon it and used it to prepare a sacrifice. And I had been\nused as a tool. My grandfather had been wrong about yessing them to death\nand destruction or else things had changed too much since his day.\nThere was only one way to destroy them. I got up from behind the\nhedge in the waning moon, wet and shaken in the hot air and started out\nlooking for Jack, still turned around in my direction. I moved into the street,\nlistening to the distant sounds of the riot and seeing in my mind the image\nof two eyes in the bottom of a shattered glass.\nI kept to the darker side of streets and to the silent areas, thinking\nthat if he wished really to hide his strategy he\'d appear in the district, with a\nsound truck perhaps, playing the friendly adviser with Wrestrum and Tobitt\nbeside him.\nThey were in civilian clothes, and I thought, Cops -- until I saw the\nbaseball bat and started to turn, hearing, "Hey, you!"\nI hesitated.\n"What\'s in that brief case?" they said, and if they\'d asked me\nanything else I might have stood still. But at the question a wave of shame\nand outrage shook me and I ran, still heading for Jack. But I was in strange\nterritory now and someone, for some reason, had removed the manhole cover\nand I felt myself plunge down, down; a long drop that ended upon a load of\ncoal that sent up a cloud of dust, and I lay in the black dark upon the black\ncoal no longer running, hiding or concerned, hearing the shifting of the coal,\nas from somewhere above their voices came floating down.\n"You see the way he went down, zoom! I was just fixing to slug the\nbastard."\n"You hit him?"\n"I don\'t know."\n"Say, Joe, you think the bastard\'s dead?"\n"Maybe. He sure is in the dark though. You can\'t even see his eyes."\n"Nigger in the coal pile, eh, Joe?"\nSomeone hollered down the hole, "Hey, black boy. Come on out. We\nwant to see what\'s in that brief case."\n"Come down and get me," I said.\n"What\'s in that brief case?"\n"You," I said, suddenly laughing. "What do you think of that?"\n"Me?"\n"All of you," I said.\n"You\'re crazy," he said.\n"But I still have you in this brief case!"\n"What\'d you steal?"\n"Can\'t you see?" I said. "Light a match."\n"What the hell\'s he talking about, Joe?"\n"Strike a match, the boogy\'s nuts."\nHigh above I saw the small flame sputter into light. They stood\nheads down, as in prayer, unable to see me back in the coal.\n"Come on down," I said. "Hal Ha! I\'ve had you in my brief case all\nthe time and you didn\'t know me then and can\'t see me now."\n"You sonofabitch!" one of them called, outraged. Then the match\nwent out and I heard something fall softly upon the coal near by. They were\ntalking above.\n"You goddam black nigger sonofabitch," someone called, "see how you\nlike this," and I heard the cover settle over the manhole with a dull clang.\nFine bits of dirt showered down as they stamped upon the lid and for a\nmoment I sent coal sliding in wild surprise, looking up, up through black\nspace to where for a second the dim light of a match sank through a circle\nof holes in the steel. Then I thought, This is the way it\'s always been, only\nnow I know it -- and rested back, calm now, placing the brief case beneath\nmy head. I could open it in the morning, push off the lid. Now I was tired,\ntoo tired; my mind retreating, the image of the two glass eyes running\ntogether like blobs of melting lead. Here it was as though the riot was gone\nand I felt the tug of sleep, seemed to move out upon black water.\nIt\'s a kind of death without hanging, I thought, a death alive. In the\nmorning I\'ll remove the lid . . . Mary, I should have gone to Mary\'s. I would\ngo now to Mary\'s in the only way that I could . . . I moved off over the\nblack water, floating, sighing . . . sleeping invisibly.\nBUT I was never to reach Mary\'s, and I was over-optimistic about\nremoving the steel cap in the morning. Great invisible waves of time flowed\nover me, but that morning never came. There was no morning nor light of\nany kind to awaken me and I slept on and on until finally I was aroused by\nhunger. Then I was up in the dark and blundering around, feeling rough\nwalls and the coal giving way beneath each step like treacherous sand. I tried\nto reach above me but found only space, unbroken and impenetrable. Then I\ntried to find the usual ladder that leads out of such holes, but there was\nnone. I had to have a light, and now on hands and knees, holding tight to\nmy brief case, I searched the coal until I found the folder of matches the\nmen had dropped -- how long ago had that been? -- but there were only\nthree and to save them I started searching for paper to make a torch, feeling\nabout slowly over the coal pile. I needed just one piece of paper to light my\nway out of the hole, but there was nothing. Next I searched my pockets,\nfinding not even a bill, or an advertising folder, or a Brotherhood leaflet. Why\nhad I destroyed Rinehart\'s throwaway? Well, there was only one thing to do\nif I was to make a torch. I\'d have to open my brief case. In it were the only\npapers I had.\nI started with my high-school diploma, applying one precious match\nwith a feeling of remote irony, even smiling as I saw the swift but feeble\nlight push back the gloom. I was in a deep basement, full of shapeless\nobjects that extended farther than I could see, and I realized that to light my\nway out I would have to burn every paper in the brief case. I moved slowly\noff, toward the darker blackness, lighting my way by these feeble torches. The\nnext to go was Clifton\'s doll, but it burned so stubbornly that I reached\ninside the case for something else. Then by the light of the smoke-sputtering\ndoll I opened a folded page. It was the anonymous letter, which burned so\nquickly that as it flamed I hurriedly unfolded another: It was that slip upon\nwhich Jack had written my Brotherhood name. I could still smell Emma\'s\nperfume even in the dampness of the cellar. And now seeing the handwriting\nof the two in the consuming flames I burned my hand and slipped to my\nknees, staring. The handwriting was the same. I knelt there, stunned,\nwatching the flames consume them. That he, or anyone at that late date,\ncould have named me and set me running with one and the same stroke of\nthe pen was too much. Suddenly I began to scream, getting up in the\ndarkness and plunging wildly about, bumping against walls, scattering coal,\nand in my anger extinguishing my feeble light.\nBut still whirling on in the blackness, knocking against the rough\nwalls of a narrow passage, banging my head and cursing, I stumbled down\nand plunged against some kind of partition and sailed headlong, coughing and\nsneezing, into another dimensionless room, where I continued to roll about\nthe floor in my outrage. How long this kept up, I do not know. It might\nhave been days, weeks; I lost all sense of time. And everytime I paused to\nrest, the outrage revived and I went off again. Then, finally, when I could\nbarely move, something seemed to say, "That\'s enough, don\'t kill yourself.\nYou\'ve run enough, you\'re through with them at last," and I collapsed, face\nforward and lay there beyond the point of exhaustion, too tired to close my\neyes. It was a state neither of dreaming nor of waking, but somewhere in\nbetween, in which I was caught like Trueblood\'s jaybird that yellow jackets\nhad paralyzed in every part but his eyes.\nBut somehow the floor had now turned to sand and the darkness to\nlight, and I lay the prisoner of a group consisting of Jack and old Emerson\nand Bledsoe and Norton and Ras and the school superintendent and a\nnumber of others whom I failed to recognize, but all of whom had run me,\nwho now pressed around me as I lay beside a river of black water, near\nwhere an armored bridge arched sharply away to where I could not see. And\nI was protesting their holding me and they were demanding that I return to\nthem and were annoyed with my refusal.\n"No," I said. "I\'m through with all your illusions and lies, I\'m\nthrough running."\n"Not quite," Jack said above the others\' angry demands, "but you\nsoon will be, unless you return. Refuse and we\'ll free you of your illusions all\nright."\n"No, thank you; I\'ll free myself," I said, struggling to rise from the\ncutting sand.\nBut now they came forward with a knife, holding me; and I felt the\nbright red pain and they took the two bloody blobs and cast them over the\nbridge, and out of my anguish I saw them curve up and catch beneath the\napex of the curving arch of the bridge, to hang there, dripping down\nthrough the sunlight into the dark red water. And while the others laughed,\nbefore my pain-sharpened eyes the whole world was slowly turning red.\n"Now you\'re free of illusions," Jack said, pointing to my seed wasting\nupon the air. "How does it feel to be free of one\'s illusions?"\nAnd I looked up through a pain so intense now that the air seemed\nto roar with the clanging of metal, hearing, HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE\nFREE OF ILLUSION . . .\nAnd now I answered, "Painful and empty," as I saw a glittering\nbutterfly circle three times around my blood-red parts, up there beneath the\nbridge\'s high arch. "But look," I said pointing. And they looked and laughed,\nand suddenly seeing their satisfied faces and understanding, I gave a Bledsoe\nlaugh, startling them. And Jack came forward, curious.\n"Why do you laugh?" he said.\n"Because at a price I now see that which I couldn\'t see," I said.\n"What does he think he sees?" they said.\nAnd Jack came closer, threatening, and I laughed. "I\'m not afraid\nnow," I said. "But if you\'ll look, you\'ll see . . . It\'s not invisible . . ."\n"See what?" they said.\n"That there hang not only my generations wasting upon the water --"\nAnd now the pain welled up and I could no longer see them.\n"But what? Go on," they said.\n"But your sun . . ."\n"Yes?"\n"And your moon . . ."\n"He\'s crazy!"\n"Your world . . ."\n"I knew he was a mystic idealist!" Tobitt said.\n"Still," I said, "there\'s your universe, and that drip-drop upon the\nwater you hear is all the history you\'ve made, all you\'re going to make. Now\nlaugh, you scientists. Let\'s hear you laugh!"\nAnd high above me now the bridge seemed to move off to where I\ncould not see, striding like a robot, an iron man, whose iron legs clanged\ndoomfully as it moved. And then I struggled up, full of sorrow and pain,\nshouting, "No, no, we must stop him!"\nAnd I awoke in the blackness.\nFully awake now, I simply lay there as though paralyzed. I could\nthink of nothing else to do. Later I would try to find my way out, but now I\ncould only lie on the floor, reliving the dream. All their faces were so vivid\nthat they seemed to stand before me beneath a spotlight. They were all up\nthere somewhere, making a mess of the world. Well, let them. I was through\nand, in spite of the dream, I was whole.\nAnd now I realized that I couldn\'t return to Mary\'s, or to any part of\nmy old life. I could approach it only from the outside, and I had been as\ninvisible to Mary as I had been to the Brotherhood. No, I couldn\'t return to\nMary\'s, or to the campus, or to the Brotherhood, or home. I could only move\nahead or stay here, underground. So I would stay here until I was chased\nout. Here, at least, I could try to think things out in peace, or, if not in\npeace, in quiet. I would take up residence underground. The end was in the\nbeginning.\nChapter 26\nSo there you have all of it that\'s important. Or at least you almost\nhave it. I\'m an invisible man and it placed me in a hole -- or showed me the\nhole I was in, if you will -- and I reluctantly accepted the fact. What else\ncould I have done? Once you get used to it, reality is as irresistible as a club,\nand I was clubbed into the cellar before I caught the hint. Perhaps that\'s the\nway it had to be; I don\'t know. Nor do I know whether accepting the lesson\nhas placed me in the rear or in the avant-garde. That, perhaps, is a lesson\nfor history, and I\'ll leave such decisions to Jack and his ilk while I try\nbelatedly to study the lesson of my own life.\nLet me be honest with you -- a feat which, by the way, I find of the\nutmost difficulty. When one is invisible he finds such problems as good and\nevil, honesty and dishonesty, of such shifting shapes that he confuses one\nwith the other, depending upon who happens to be looking through him at\nthe time. Well, now I\'ve been trying to look through myself, and there\'s a\nrisk in it. I was never more hated than when I tried to be honest. Or when,\neven as just now I\'ve tried to articulate exactly what I felt to be the truth.\nNo one was satisfied -- not even I. On the other hand, I\'ve never been more\nloved and appreciated than when I tried to "justify" and affirm someone\'s\nmistaken beliefs; or when I\'ve tried to give my friends the incorrect, absurd\nanswers they wished to hear. In my presence they could talk and agree with\nthemselves, the world was nailed down, and they loved it. They received a\nfeeling of security. But here was the rub: Too often, in order to justify them,\nI had to take myself by the throat and choke myself until my eyes bulged\nand my tongue hung out and wagged like the door of an empty house in a\nhigh wind. Oh, yes, it made them happy and it made me sick. So I became\nill of affirmation, of saying "yes" against the nay-saying of my stomach -- not\nto mention my brain.\nThere is, by the way, an area in which a man\'s feelings are more\nrational than his mind, and it is precisely in that area that his will is pulled\nin several directions at the same time. You might sneer at this, but I know\nnow. I was pulled this way and that for longer than I can remember. And\nmy problem was that I always tried to go in everyone\'s way but my own. I\nhave also been called one thing and then another while no one really wished\nto hear what I called myself. So after years of trying to adopt the opinions of\nothers I finally rebelled. I am an invisible man. Thus I have come a long way\nand returned and boomeranged a long way from the point in society toward\nwhich I originally aspired.\nSo I took to the cellar; I hibernated. I got away from it all. But that\nwasn\'t enough. I couldn\'t be still even in hibernation. Because, damn it,\nthere\'s the mind, the mind. It wouldn\'t let me rest. Gin, jazz and dreams\nwere not enough. Books were not enough. My belated appreciation of the\ncrude joke that had kept me running, was not enough. And my mind\nrevolved again and again back to my grandfather. And, despite the farce that\nended my attempt to say "yes" to the Brotherhood, I\'m still plagued by his\ndeathbed advice . . . Perhaps he hid his meaning deeper than I thought,\nperhaps his anger threw me off -- I can\'t decide. Could he have meant --\nhell, he must have meant the principle, that we were to affirm the principle\non which the country was built and not the men, or at least not the men\nwho did the violence. Did he mean say "yes" because he knew that the\nprinciple was greater than the men, greater than the numbers and the vicious\npower and all the methods used to corrupt its name? Did he mean to affirm\nthe principle, which they themselves had dreamed into being out of the chaos\nand darkness of the feudal past, and which they had violated and\ncompromised to the point of absurdity even in their own corrupt minds? Or\ndid he mean that we had to take the responsibility for all of it, for the men\nas well as the principle, because we were the heirs who must use the\nprinciple because no other fitted our needs? Not for the power or for\nvindication, but because we, with the given circumstance of our origin, could\nonly thus find transcendence? Was it that we of all, we, most of all, had to\naffirm the principle, the plan in whose name we had been brutalized and\nsacrificed -- not because we would always be weak nor because we were\nafraid or opportunistic, but because we were older than they, in the sense of\nwhat it took to live in the world with others and because they had exhausted\nin us, some -- not much, but some -- of the human greed and smallness, yes,\nand the fear and superstition that had kept them running. (Oh, yes, they\'re\nrunning too, running all over themselves.) Or was it, did he mean that we\nshould affirm the principle because we, through no fault of our own, were\nlinked to all the others in the loud, clamoring semi-visible world, that world\nseen only as a fertile field for exploitation by Jack and his kind, and with\ncondescension by Norton and his, who were tired of being the mere pawns in\nthe futile game of "making history"? Had he seen that for these too we had\nto say "yes" to the principle, lest they turn upon us to destroy both it and\nus?\n"Agree \'em to death and destruction," grandfather had advised. Hell,\nweren\'t they their own death and their own destruction except as the\nprinciple lived in them and in us? And here\'s the cream of the joke: Weren\'t\nwe part of them as well as apart from them and subject to die when they\ndied? I can\'t figure it out; it escapes me. But what do I really want, I\'ve\nasked myself. Certainly not the freedom of a Rinehart or the power of a Jack,\nnor simply the freedom not to run. No, but the next step I couldn\'t make, so\nI\'ve remained in the hole.\nI\'m not blaming anyone for this state of affairs, mind you; nor\nmerely crying mea culpa. The fact is that you carry part of your sickness\nwithin you, at least I do as an invisible man. I carried my sickness and\nthough for a long time I tried to place it in the outside world, the attempt to\nwrite it down shows me that at least half of it lay within me. It came upon\nme slowly, like that strange disease that affects those black men whom you\nsee turning slowly from black to albino, their pigment disappearing as under\nthe radiation of some cruel, invisible ray. You go along for years knowing\nsomething is wrong, then suddenly you discover that you\'re as transparent as\nair. At first you tell yourself that it\'s all a dirty joke, or that it\'s due to the\n"political situation." But deep down you come to suspect that you\'re yourself\nto blame, and you stand naked and shivering before the millions of eyes who\nlook through you unseeingly. That is the real soul-sickness, the spear in the\nside, the drag by the neck through the mob-angry town, the Grand\nInquisition, the embrace of the Maiden, the rip in the belly with the guts\nspilling out, the trip to the chamber with the deadly gas that ends in the\noven so hygienically clean -- only it\'s worse because you continue stupidly to\nlive. But live you must, and you can either make passive love to your\nsickness or burn it out and go on to the next conflicting phase.\nYes, but what is the next phase? How often have I tried to find it!\nOver and over again I\'ve gone up above to seek it out. For, like almost\neveryone else in our country, I started out with my share of optimism. I\nbelieved in hard work and progress and action, but now, after first being\n"for" society and then "against" it, I assign myself no rank or any limit, and\nsuch an attitude is very much against the trend of the times. But my world\nhas become one of infinite possibilities. What a phrase -- still it\'s a good\nphrase and a good view of life, and a man shouldn\'t accept any other; that\nmuch I\'ve learned underground. Until some gang succeeds in putting the\nworld in a strait jacket, its definition is possibility. Step outside the narrow\nborders of what men call reality and you step into chaos -- ask Rinehart, he\'s\na master of it -- or imagination. That too I\'ve learned in the cellar, and not\nby deadening my sense of perception; I\'m invisible, not blind.\nNo indeed, the world is just as concrete, ornery, vile and sublimely\nwonderful as before, only now I better understand my relation to it and it to\nme. I\'ve come a long way from those days when, full of illusion, I lived a\npublic life and attempted to function under the assumption that the world\nwas solid and all the relationships therein. Now I know men are different and\nthat all life is divided and that only in division is there true health. Hence\nagain I have stayed in my hole, because up above there\'s an increasing\npassion to make men conform to a pattern. Just as in my nightmare, Jack\nand the boys are waiting with their knives, looking for the slightest excuse to\n. . . well, to "ball the jack," and I do not refer to the old dance step,\nalthough what they\'re doing is making the old eagle rock dangerously.\nWhence all this passion toward conformity anyway? -- diversity is the\nword. Let man keep his many parts and you\'ll have no tyrant states. Why, if\nthey follow this conformity business they\'ll end up by forcing me, an invisible\nman, to become white, which is not a color but the lack of one. Must I strive\ntoward colorlessness? But seriously, and without snobbery, think of what the\nworld would lose if that should happen. America is woven of many strands; I\nwould recognize them and let it so remain. It\'s "winner take nothing" that is\nthe great truth of our country or of any country. Life is to be lived, not\ncontrolled; and humanity is won by continuing to play in face of certain\ndefeat. Our fate is to become one, and yet many -- This is not prophecy, but\ndescription. Thus one of the greatest jokes in the world is the spectacle of\nthe whites busy escaping blackness and becoming blacker every day, and the\nblacks striving toward whiteness, becoming quite dull and gray. None of us\nseems to know who he is or where he\'s going.\nWhich reminds me of something that occurred the other day in the\nsubway. At first I saw only an old gentleman who for the moment was lost. I\nknew he was lost, for as I looked down the platform I saw him approach\nseveral people and turn away without speaking. He\'s lost, I thought, and he\'ll\nkeep coming until he sees me, then he\'ll ask his direction. Maybe there\'s an\nembarrassment in it if he admits he\'s lost to a strange white man. Perhaps to\nlose a sense of where you are implies the danger of losing a sense of who\nyou are. That must be it, I thought -- to lose your direction is to lose your\nface. So here he comes to ask his direction from the lost, the invisible. Very\nwell, I\'ve learned to live without direction. Let him ask.\nBut then he was only a few feet away and I recognized him; it was\nMr. Norton. The old gentleman was thinner and wrinkled now but as dapper\nas ever. And seeing him made all the old life live in me for an instant, and I\nsmiled with tear-stinging eyes. Then it was over, dead, and when he asked\nme how to get to Centre Street, I regarded him with mixed feelings.\n"Don\'t you know me?" I said.\n"Should I?" he said.\n"You see me?" I said, watching him tensely.\n"Why, of course -- Sir, do you know the way to Centre Street?"\n"So. Last time it was the Golden Day, now it\'s Centre Street. You\'ve\nretrenched, sir. But don\'t you know who I am?"\n"Young man, I\'m in a hurry," he said, cupping a hand to his ear.\n"Why should I know you?"\n"Because I\'m your destiny."\n"My destiny, did you say?" He gave me a puzzled stare, backing\naway. "Young man, are you well? Which train did you say I should take?"\n"I didn\'t say," I said, shaking my head. "Now, aren\'t you ashamed?"\n"Ashamed? ASHAMED!" he said indignantly.\nI laughed, suddenly taken by the idea. "Because, Mr. Norton, if you\ndon\'t know where you are, you probably don\'t know who you are. So you\ncame to me out of shame. You are ashamed, now aren\'t you?"\n"Young man, I\'ve lived too long in this world to be ashamed of\nanything. Are you light-headed from hunger? How do you know my name?"\n"But I\'m your destiny, I made you. Why shouldn\'t I know you?" I\nsaid, walking closer and seeing him back against a pillar. He looked around\nlike a cornered animal. He thought I was mad.\n"Don\'t be afraid, Mr. Norton," I said. "There\'s a guard down the\nplatform there. You\'re safe. Take any train; they all go to the Golden D --"\nBut now an express had rolled up and the old man was disappearing\nquite spryly inside one of its doors. I stood there laughing hysterically. I\nlaughed all the way back to my hole.\nBut after I had laughed I was thrown back on my thoughts -- how\nhad it all happened? And I asked myself if it were only a joke and I couldn\'t\nanswer. Since then I\'ve sometimes been overcome with a passion to return\ninto that "heart of darkness" across the Mason-Dixon line, but then I remind\nmyself that the true darkness lies within my own mind, and the idea loses\nitself in the gloom. Still the passion persists. Sometimes I feel the need to\nreaffirm all of it, the whole unhappy territory and all the things loved and\nunlovable in it, for all of it is part of me. Till now, however, this is as far as\nI\'ve ever gotten, for all life seen from the hole of invisibility is absurd.\nSo why do I write, torturing myself to put it down? Because in spite\nof myself I\'ve learned some things. Without the possibility of action, all\nknowledge comes to one labeled "file and forget," and I can neither file nor\nforget. Nor will certain ideas forget me; they keep filing away at my lethargy,\nmy complacency. Why should I be the one to dream this nightmare? Why\nshould I be dedicated and set aside -- yes, if not to at least tell a few people\nabout it? There seems to be no escape. Here I\'ve set out to throw my anger\ninto the world\'s face, but now that I\'ve tried to put it all down the old\nfascination with playing a role returns, and I\'m drawn upward again. So that\neven before I finish I\'ve failed (maybe my anger is too heavy; perhaps, being\na talker, I\'ve used too many words). But I\'ve failed. The very act of trying to\nput it all down has confused me and negated some of the anger and some of\nthe bitterness. So it is that now I denounce and defend, or feel prepared to\ndefend. I condemn and affirm, say no and say yes, say yes and say no. I\ndenounce because though implicated and partially responsible, I have been\nhurt to the point of abysmal pain, hurt to the point of invisibility. And I\ndefend because in spite of all I find that I love. In order to get some of it\ndown I have to love. I sell you no phony forgiveness, I\'m a desperate man --\nbut too much of your life will be lost, its meaning lost, unless you approach\nit as much through love as through hate. So I approach it through division.\nSo I denounce and I defend and I hate and I love.\nPerhaps that makes me a little bit as human as my grandfather.\nOnce I thought my grandfather incapable of thoughts about humanity, but I\nwas wrong. Why should an old slave use such a phrase as, "This and this or\nthis has made me more human," as I did in my arena speech? Hell, he never\nhad any doubts about his humanity -- that was left to his "free" offspring. He\naccepted his humanity just as he accepted the principle. It was his, and the\nprinciple lives on in all its human and absurd diversity. So now having tried\nto put it down I have disarmed myself in the process. You won\'t believe in\nmy invisibility and you\'ll fail to see how any principle that applies to you\ncould apply to me. You\'ll fail to see it even though death waits for both of us\nif you don\'t. Nevertheless, the very disarmament has brought me to a\ndecision. The hibernation is over. I must shake off the old skin and come up\nfor breath. There\'s a stench in the air, which, from this distance underground,\nmight be the smell either of death or of spring -- I hope of spring. But don\'t\nlet me trick you, there is a death in the smell of spring and in the smell of\nthee as in the smell of me. And if nothing more, invisibility has taught my\nnose to classify the stenches of death.\nIn going underground, I whipped it all except the mind, the mind.\nAnd the mind that has conceived a plan of living must never lose sight of\nthe chaos against which that pattern was conceived. That goes for societies as\nwell as for individuals. Thus, having tried to give pattern to the chaos which\nlives within the pattern of your certainties, I must come out, I must emerge.\nAnd there\'s still a conflict within me: With Louis Armstrong one half of me\nsays, "Open the window and let the foul air out," while the other says, "It\nwas good green corn before the harvest." Of course Louis was kidding, he\nwouldn\'t have thrown old Bad Air out, because it would have broken up the\nmusic and the dance, when it was the good music that came from the bell of\nold Bad Air\'s horn that counted. Old Bad Air is still around with his music\nand his dancing and his diversity, and I\'ll be up and around with mine. And,\nas I said before, a decision has been made. I\'m shaking off the old skin and\nI\'ll leave it here in the hole. I\'m coming out, no less invisible without it, but\ncoming out nevertheless. And I suppose it\'s damn well time. Even\nhibernations can be overdone, come to think of it. Perhaps that\'s my greatest\nsocial crime, I\'ve overstayed my hibernation, since there\'s a possibility that\neven an invisible man has a socially responsible role to play.\n"Ah," I can hear you say, "so it was all a build-up to bore us with\nhis buggy jiving. He only wanted us to listen to him rave!" But only partially\ntrue: Being invisible and without substance, a disembodied voice, as it were,\nwhat else could I do? What else but try to tell you what was really\nhappening when your eyes were looking through? And it is this which\nfrightens me:\nWho knows but that, on the lower frequencies, I speak for you?\nScan Notes, v3.0: Proofed carefully against DT, italics and special characters\nintact. Because of the print quality in my copy of the book, many of the f\'s\nOCR\'d as t\'s. I think I found them all...';
