""You are saved,"" cried Captain Delano, more and more astonished and pained;
""you are saved: what has cast such a shadow upon you?""
Herman Melville, Benito Cereno
HARRY: I tell you, it is not me you are looking at,
Not me you are grinning at, not me your confidential looks
Incriminate, but that other person, if person,
You thought I was: let your necrophily
Feed upon that carcase. . .
T. S. Eliot, Family Reunion
Chapter 0
I am an invisible man. No, I am not a spook like those who haunted
Edgar Allan Poe; nor am I one of your Hollywood-movie ectoplasms. I am a
man of substance, of flesh and bone, fiber and liquids -- and I might even be
said to possess a mind. I am invisible, understand, simply because people
refuse to see me. Like the bodiless heads you see sometimes in circus
sideshows, it is as though I have been surrounded by mirrors of hard,
distorting glass. When they approach me they see only my surroundings,
themselves, or figments of their imagination -- indeed, everything and
anything except me.
Nor is my invisibility exactly a matter of a bio-chemical accident to
my epidermis. That invisibility to which I refer occurs because of a peculiar
disposition of the eyes of those with whom I come in contact. A matter of
the construction of their inner eyes, those eyes with which they look through
their physical eyes upon reality. I am not complaining, nor am I protesting
either. It is sometimes advantageous to be unseen, although it is most often
rather wearing on the nerves. Then too, you're constantly being bumped
against by those of poor vision. Or again, you often doubt if you really exist.
You wonder whether you aren't simply a phantom in other people's minds.
Say, a figure in a nightmare which the sleeper tries with all his strength to
destroy. It's when you feel like this that, out of resentment, you begin to
bump people back. And, let me confess, you feel that way most of the time.
You ache with the need to convince yourself that you do exist in the real
world, that you're a part of all the sound and anguish, and you strike out
with your fists, you curse and you swear to make them recognize you. And,
alas, it's seldom successful.
One night I accidentally bumped into a man, and perhaps because of
the near darkness he saw me and called me an insulting name. I sprang at
him, seized his coat lapels and demanded that he apologize. He was a tall
blond man, and as my face came close to his he looked insolently out of his
blue eyes and cursed me, his breath hot in my face as he struggled. I pulled
his chin down sharp upon the crown of my head, butting him as I had seen
the West Indians do, and I felt his flesh tear and the blood gush out, and I
yelled, ""Apologize! Apologize!"" But he continued to curse and struggle, and I
butted him again and again until he went down heavily, on his knees,
profusely bleeding. I kicked him repeatedly, in a frenzy because he still
uttered insults though his lips were frothy with blood. Oh yes, I kicked him!
And in my outrage I got out my knife and prepared to slit his throat, right
there beneath the lamplight in the deserted street, holding him by the collar
with one hand, and opening the knife with my teeth -- when it occurred to
me that the man had not seen me, actually; that he, as far as he knew, was
in the midst of a walking nightmare! And I stopped the blade, slicing the air
as I pushed him away, letting him fall back to the street. I stared at him
hard as the lights of a car stabbed through the darkness. He lay there,
moaning on the asphalt; a man almost killed by a phantom. It unnerved me.
I was both disgusted and ashamed. I was like a drunken man myself,
wavering about on weakened legs. Then I was amused. Something in this
man's thick head had sprung out and beaten him within an inch of his life. I
began to laugh at this crazy discovery. Would he have awakened at the point
of death? Would Death himself have freed him for wakeful living? But I
didn't linger. I ran away into the dark, laughing so hard I feared I might
rupture myself. The next day I saw his picture in the Daily News, beneath a
caption stating that he had been ""mugged."" Poor fool, poor blind fool, I
thought with sincere compassion, mugged by an invisible man!
Most of the time (although I do not choose as I once did to deny
the violence of my days by ignoring it) I am not so overtly violent. I
remember that I am invisible and walk softly so as not to awaken the
sleeping ones. Sometimes it is best not to awaken them; there are few things
in the world as dangerous as sleepwalkers. I learned in time though that it is
possible to carry on a fight against them without their realizing it. For
instance, I have been carrying on a fight with Monopolated Light & Power for
some time now. I use their service and pay them nothing at all, and they
don't know it. Oh, they suspect that power is being drained off, but they
don't know where. All they know is that according to the master meter back
there in their power station a hell of a lot of free current is disappearing
somewhere into the jungle of Harlem. The joke, of course, is that I don't live
in Harlem but in a border area. Several years ago (before I discovered the
advantage of being invisible) I went through the routine process of buying
service and paying their outrageous rates. But no more. I gave up all that,
along with my apartment, and my old way of life: That way based upon the
fallacious assumption that I, like other men, was visible. Now, aware of my
invisibility, I live rent-free in a building rented strictly to whites, in a section
of the basement that was shut off and forgotten during the nineteenth
century, which I discovered when I was trying to escape in the night from
Ras the Destroyer. But that's getting too far ahead of the story, almost to the
end, although the end is in the beginning and lies far ahead.
The point now is that I found a home -- or a hole in the ground, as
you will. Now don't jump to the conclusion that because I call my home a
""hole"" it is damp and cold like a grave; there are cold holes and warm holes.
Mine is a warm hole. And remember, a bear retires to his hole for the winter
and lives until spring; then he comes strolling out like the Easter chick
breaking from its shell. I say all this to assure you that it is incorrect to
assume that, because I'm invisible and live in a hole, I am dead. I am
neither dead nor in a state of suspended animation. Call me Jack-the-Bear,
for I am in a state of hibernation.
My hole is warm and full of light. Yes, full of light. I doubt if there
is a brighter spot in all New York than this hole of mine, and I do not
exclude Broadway. Or the Empire State Building on a photographer's dream
night. But that is taking advantage of you. Those two spots are among the
darkest of our whole civilization -- pardon me, our whole culture (an
important distinction, I've heard) -- which might sound like a hoax, or a
contradiction, but that (by contradiction, I mean) is how the world moves:
Not like an arrow, but a boomerang. (Beware of those who speak of the
spiral of history; they are preparing a boomerang. Keep a steel helmet handy.)
I know; I have been boomeranged across my head so much that I now can
see the darkness of lightness. And I love light. Perhaps you'll think it strange
that an invisible man should need light, desire light, love light. But maybe it
is exactly because I am invisible. Light confirms my reality, gives birth to my
form. A beautiful girl once told me of a recurring nightmare in which she lay
in the center of a large dark room and felt her face expand until it filled the
whole room, becoming a formless mass while her eyes ran in bilious jelly up
the chimney. And so it is with me. Without light I am not only invisible, but
formless as well; and to be unaware of one's form is to live a death. I
myself, after existing some twenty years, did not become alive until I
discovered my invisibility.
That is why I fight my battle with Monopolated Light & Power. The
deeper reason, I mean: It allows me to feel my vital aliveness. I also fight
them for taking so much of my money before I learned to protect myself. In
my hole in the basement there are exactly 1,369 lights. I've wired the entire
ceiling, every inch of it. And not with fluorescent bulbs, but with the older,
more-expensive-to-operate kind, the filament type. An act of sabotage, you
know. I've already begun to wire the wall. A junk man I know, a man of
vision, has supplied me with wire and sockets. Nothing, storm or flood, must
get in the way of our need for light and ever more and brighter light. The
truth is the light and light is the truth. When I finish all four walls, then I'll
start on the floor. Just how that will go, I don't know. Yet when you have
lived invisible as long as I have you develop a certain ingenuity. I'll solve the
problem. And maybe I'll invent a gadget to place my coffeepot on the fire
while I lie in bed, and even invent a gadget to warm my bed -- like the
fellow I saw in one of the picture magazines who made himself a gadget to
warm his shoes! Though invisible, I am in the great American tradition of
tinkers. That makes me kin to Ford, Edison and Franklin. Call me, since I
have a theory and a concept, a ""thinker-tinker."" Yes, I'll warm my shoes; they
need it, they're usually full of holes. I'll do that and more.
Now I have one radio-phonograph; I plan to have five. There is a
certain acoustical deadness in my hole, and when I have music I want to feel
its vibration, not only with my ear but with my whole body. I'd like to hear
five recordings of Louis Armstrong playing and singing ""What Did I Do to Be
so Black and Blue"" -- all at the same time. Sometimes now I listen to Louis
while I have my favorite dessert of vanilla ice cream and sloe gin. I pour the
red liquid over the white mound, watching it glisten and the vapor rising as
Louis bends that military instrument into a beam of lyrical sound. Perhaps I
like Louis Armstrong because he's made poetry out of being invisible. I think
it must be because he's unaware that he is invisible. And my own grasp of
invisibility aids me to understand his music. Once when I asked for a
cigarette, some jokers gave me a reefer, which I lighted when I got home and
sat listening to my phonograph. It was a strange evening. Invisibility, let me
explain, gives one a slightly different sense of time, you're never quite on the
beat. Sometimes you're ahead and sometimes behind. Instead of the swift and
imperceptible flowing of time, you are aware of its nodes, those points where
time stands still or from which it leaps ahead. And you slip into the breaks
and look around. That's what you hear vaguely in Louis' music.
Once I saw a prizefighter boxing a yokel. The fighter was swift and
amazingly scientific. His body was one violent flow of rapid rhythmic action.
He hit the yokel a hundred times while the yokel held up his arms in
stunned surprise. But suddenly the yokel, rolling about in the gale of boxing
gloves, struck one blow and knocked science, speed and footwork as cold as a
well-digger's posterior. The smart money hit the canvas. The long shot got the
nod. The yokel had simply stepped inside of his opponent's sense of time. So
under the spell of the reefer I discovered a new analytical way of listening to
music. The unheard sounds came through, and each melodic line existed of
itself, stood out clearly from all the rest, said its piece, and waited patiently
for the other voices to speak. That night I found myself hearing not only in
time, but in space as well. I not only entered the music but descended, like
Dante, into its depths. And beneath the swiftness of the hot tempo there was
a slower tempo and a cave and I entered it and looked around and heard an
old woman singing a spiritual as full of Weltschmerz as flamenco, and
beneath that lay a still lower level on which I saw a beautiful girl the color
of ivory pleading in a voice like my mother's as she stood before a group of
slave owners who bid for her naked body, and below that I found a lower
level and a more rapid tempo and I heard someone shout:
""Brothers and sisters, my text this morning is the 'Blackness of
Blackness.' ""
And a congregation of voices answered: ""That blackness is most
black, brother, most black . . .""
""In the beginning . . .""
""At the very start,"" they cried.
"". . . there was blackness . . .""
""Preach it . . .""
"". . . and the sun . . .""
""The sun, Lawd . . .""
"". . . was bloody red . . .""
""Red . . .""
""Now black is . . ."" the preacher shouted.
""Bloody . . .""
""I said black is . . .""
""Preach it, brother . . .""
"". . . an' black ain't . . ""
""Red, Lawd, red: He said it's red!""
""Amen, brother . . .""
""Black will git you . . .""
""Yes, it will . . .""
"". . . an' black won't . . .""
""Naw, it won't!""
""It do . . .""
""It do, Lawd . . .""
"". . . an' it don't.""
""Halleluiah . . .""
"". . . It'll put you, glory, glory, Oh my Lawd, in the WHALE'S
BELLY.""
""Preach it, dear brother . . .""
"". . . an' make you tempt . . .""
""Good God a-mighty!""
""Old Aunt Nelly!""
""Black will make you . . .""
""Black . . .""
"". . . or black will un-make you.""
""Ain't it the truth, Lawd?""
And at that point a voice of trombone timbre screamed at me, ""Git
out of, here, you fool! Is you ready to commit treason?""
And I tore myself away, hearing the old singer of spirituals moaning,
""Go curse your God, boy, and die.""
I stopped and questioned her, asked her what was wrong.
""I dearly loved my master, son,"" she said.
""You should have hated him,"" I said.
""He gave me several sons,"" she said, ""and because I loved my sons I
learned to love their father though I hated him too.""
""I too have become acquainted with ambivalence,"" I said. ""That's why
I'm here.""
""What's that?""
""Nothing, a word that doesn't explain it. Why do you moan?""
""I moan this way 'cause he's dead,"" she said.
""Then tell me, who is that laughing upstairs?""
""Them's my sons. They glad.""
""Yes, I can understand that too,"" I said.
""I laughs too, but I moans too. He promised to set us free but he
never could bring hisself to do it. Still I loved him . . .""
""Loved him? You mean . . .""
""Oh yes, but 1 loved something else even more.""
""What more?""
""Freedom.""
""Freedom,"" I said. ""Maybe freedom lies in hating.""
""Naw, son, it's in loving. I loved him and give him the poison and
he withered away like a frost-bit apple. Them boys woulda tore him to pieces
with they homemake knives.""
""A mistake was made somewhere,"" I said, ""I'm confused."" And I
wished to say other things, but the laughter upstairs became too loud and
moan-like for me and I tried to break out of it, but I couldn't. Just as I was
leaving I felt an urgent desire to ask her what freedom was and went back.
She sat with her head in her hands, moaning softly; her leather-brown face
was filled with sadness.
""Old woman, what is this freedom you love so well?"" I asked around
a corner of my mind.
She looked surprised, then thoughtful, then baffled. ""I done forgot,
son. It's all mixed up. First I think it's one thing, then I think it's another. It
gits my head to spinning. I guess now it ain't nothing but knowing how to
say what I got up in my head. But it's a hard job, son. Too much is done
happen to me in too short a time. Hit's like I have a fever. Ever' time I
starts to walk my head gits to swirling and I falls down. Or if it ain't that,
it's the boys; they gits to laughing and wants to kill up the white folks.
They's bitter, that's what they is . . .""
""But what about freedom?""
""Leave me 'lone, boy; my head aches!""
I left her, feeling dizzy myself. I didn't get far.
Suddenly one of the sons, a big fellow six feet tall, appeared out of
nowhere and struck me with his fist.
""What's the matter, man?"" I cried.
""You made Ma cry!""
""But how?"" I said, dodging a blow.
""Askin' her them questions, that's how. Git outa here and stay, and
next time you got questions like that, ask yourself!""
He held me in a grip like cold stone, his fingers fastening upon my
windpipe until I thought I would suffocate before he finally allowed me to go.
I stumbled about dazed, the music beating hysterically in my ears. It was
dark. My head cleared and I wandered down a dark narrow passage, thinking
I heard his footsteps hurrying behind me. I was sore, and into my being had
come a profound craving for tranquillity, for peace and quiet, a state I felt I
could never achieve. For one thing, the trumpet was blaring and the rhythm
was too hectic. A tomtom beating like heart-thuds began drowning out the
trumpet, filling my ears. I longed for water and I heard it rushing through
the cold mains my fingers touched as I felt my way, but I couldn't stop to
search because of the footsteps behind me.
""Hey, Ras,"" I called. ""Is it you, Destroyer? Rinehart?""
No answer, only the rhythmic footsteps behind me. Once I tried
crossing the road, but a speeding machine struck me, scraping the skin from
my leg as it roared past.
Then somehow I came out of it, ascending hastily from this
underworld of sound to hear Louis Armstrong innocently asking,
What did I do
To be so black
And blue?
At first I was afraid; this familiar music had demanded action, the
kind of which I was incapable, and yet had I lingered there beneath the
surface I might have attempted to act. Nevertheless, I know now that few
really listen to this music. I sat on the chair's edge in a soaking sweat, as
though each of my 1,369 bulbs had everyone become a klieg light in an
individual setting for a third degree with Ras and Rinehart in charge. It was
exhausting -- as though I had held my breath continuously for an hour under
the terrifying serenity that comes from days of intense hunger. And yet, it
was a strangely satisfying experience for an invisible man to hear the silence
of sound. I had discovered unrecognized compulsions of my being -- even
though I could not answer ""yes"" to their promptings. I haven't smoked a
reefer since, however; not because they're illegal, but because to see around
corners is enough (that is not unusual when you are invisible). But to hear
around them is too much; it inhibits action. And despite Brother Jack and all
that sad, lost period of the Brotherhood, I believe in nothing if not in action.
Please, a definition: A hibernation is a covert preparation for a more
overt action.
Besides, the drug destroys one's sense of time completely. If that
happened, I might forget to dodge some bright morning and some cluck
would run me down with an orange and yellow street car, or a bilious bus!
Or I might forget to leave my hole when the moment for action presents
itself.
Meanwhile I enjoy my life with the compliments of Monopolated
Light & Power. Since you never recognize me even when in closest contact
with me, and since, no doubt, you'll hardly believe that I exist, it won't
matter if you know that I tapped a power line leading into the building and
ran it into my hole in the ground. Before that I lived in the darkness into
which I was chased, but now I see. I've illuminated the blackness of my
invisibility -- and vice versa. And so I play the invisible music of my
isolation. The last statement doesn't seem just right, does it? But it is; you
hear this music simply because music is heard and seldom seen, except by
musicians. Could this compulsion to put invisibility down in black and white
be thus an urge to make music of invisibility? But I am an orator, a rabble
rouser -- Am? I was, and perhaps shall be again. Who knows? All sickness is
not unto death, neither is invisibility.
I can hear you say, ""What a horrible, irresponsible bastard!"" And
you're right. I leap to agree with you. I am one of the most irresponsible
beings that ever lived. Irresponsibility is part of my invisibility; any way you
face it, it is a denial. But to whom can I be responsible, and why should I
be, when you refuse to see me? And wait until I reveal how truly
irresponsible I am. Responsibility rests upon recognition, and recognition is a
form of agreement. Take the man whom I almost killed: Who was responsible
for that near murder -- I? I don't think so, and I refuse it. I won't buy it.
You can't give it to me. He bumped me, he insulted me. Shouldn't he, for his
own personal safety, have recognized my hysteria, my ""danger potential""? He,
let us say, was lost in a dream world. But didn't he control that dream world
-- which, alas, is only too real! -- and didn't he rule me out of it? And if he
had yelled for a policeman, wouldn't I have been taken for the offending one?
Yes, yes, yes! Let me agree with you, I was the irresponsible one; for I
should have used my knife to protect the higher interests of society. Some
day that kind of foolishness will cause us tragic trouble. All dreamers and
sleepwalkers must pay the price, and even the invisible victim is responsible
for the fate of all. But I shirked that responsibility; I became too snarled in
the incompatible notions that buzzed within my brain. I was a coward . . .
But what did I do to be so blue? Bear with me.
Chapter 1
It goes a long way back, some twenty years. All my life I had been
looking for something, and everywhere I turned someone tried to tell me
what it was. I accepted their answers too, though they were often in
contradiction and even self-contradictory. I was na?e. I was looking for myself
and asking everyone except myself questions which I, and only I, could
answer. It took me a long time and much painful boomeranging of my
expectations to achieve a realization everyone else appears to have been born
with: That I am nobody but myself. But first I had to discover that I am an
invisible man!
And yet I am no freak of nature, nor of history. I was in the cards,
other things having been equal (or unequal) eighty-five years ago. I am not
ashamed of my grandparents for having been slaves. I am only ashamed of
myself for having at one time been ashamed. About eighty-five years ago they
were told that they were free, united with others of our country in everything
pertaining to the common good, and, in everything social, separate like the
fingers of the hand. And they believed it. They exulted in it. They stayed in
their place, worked hard, and brought up my father to do the same. But my
grandfather is the one. He was an odd old guy, my grandfather, and I am
told I take after him. It was he who caused the trouble. On his deathbed he
called my father to him and said, ""Son, after I'm gone I want you to keep up
the good fight. I never told you, but our life is a war and I have been a
traitor all my born days, a spy in the enemy's country ever since I give up
my gun back in the Reconstruction. Live with your head in the lion's mouth.
I want you to overcome 'em with yeses, undermine 'em with grins, agree 'em
to death and destruction, let 'em swoller you till they vomit or bust wide
open."" They thought the old man had gone out of his mind. He had been the
meekest of men. The younger children were rushed from the room, the
shades drawn and the flame of the lamp turned so low that it sputtered on
the wick like the old man's breathing. ""Learn it to the younguns,"" he
whispered fiercely; then he died.
But my folks were more alarmed over his last words than over his
dying. It was as though he had not died at all, his words caused so much
anxiety. I was warned emphatically to forget what he had said and, indeed,
this is the first time it has been mentioned outside the family circle. It had a
tremendous effect upon me, however. I could never be sure of what he
meant. Grandfather had been a quiet old man who never made any trouble,
yet on his deathbed he had called himself a traitor and a spy, and he had
spoken of his meekness as a dangerous activity. It became a constant puzzle
which lay unanswered in the back of my mind. And whenever things went
well for me I remembered my grandfather and felt guilty and uncomfortable.
It was as though I was carrying out his advice in spite of myself. And to
make it worse, everyone loved me for it. I was praised by the most lily-white
men of the town. I was considered an example of desirable conduct -- just as
my grandfather had been. And what puzzled me was that the old man had
defined it as treachery. When I was praised for my conduct I felt a guilt that
in some way I was doing something that was really against the wishes of the
white folks, that if they had understood they would have desired me to act
just the opposite, that I should have been sulky and mean, and that that
really would have been what they wanted, even though they were fooled and
thought they wanted me to act as I did. It made me afraid that some day
they would look upon me as a traitor and I would be lost. Still I was more
afraid to act any other way because they didn't like that at all. The old man's
words were like a curse. On my graduation day I delivered an oration in
which I showed that humility was the secret, indeed, the very essence of
progress. (Not that I believed this -- how could I, remembering my
grandfather? -- I only believed that it worked.) It was a great success.
Everyone praised me and I was invited to give the speech at a gathering of
the town's leading white citizens. It was a triumph for our whole community.
It was in the main ballroom of the leading hotel. When I got there I
discovered that it was on the occasion of a smoker, and I was told that since
I was to be there anyway I might as well take part in the battle royal to be
fought by some of my schoolmates as part of the entertainment. The battle
royal came first.
All of the town's big shots were there in their tuxedoes, wolfing down
the buffet foods, drinking beer and whiskey and smoking black cigars. It was
a large room with a high ceiling. Chairs were arranged in neat rows around
three sides of a portable boxing ring. The fourth side was clear, revealing a
gleaming space of polished floor. I had some misgivings over the battle royal,
by the way. Not from a distaste for fighting, but because I didn't care too
much for the other fellows who were to take part. They were tough guys who
seemed to have no grandfather's curse worrying their minds. No one could
mistake their toughness. And besides, I suspected that fighting a battle royal
might detract from the dignity of my speech. In those pre-invisible days I
visualized myself as a potential Booker T. Washington. But the other fellows
didn't care too much for me either, and there were nine of them. I felt
superior to them in my way, and I didn't like the manner in which we were
all crowded together into the servants' elevator. Nor did they like my being
there. In fact, as the warmly lighted floors flashed past the elevator we had
words over the fact that I, by taking part in the fight, had knocked one of
their friends out of a night's work.
We were led out of the elevator through a rococo hall into an
anteroom and told to get into our fighting togs. Each of us was issued a pair
of boxing gloves and ushered out into the big mirrored hall, which we
entered looking cautiously about us and whispering, lest we might accidentally
be heard above the noise of the room. It was foggy with cigar smoke. And
already the whiskey was taking effect. I was shocked to see some of the most
important men of the town quite tipsy. They were all there -- bankers,
lawyers, judges, doctors, fire chiefs, teachers, merchants. Even one of the
more fashionable pastors. Something we could not see was going on up front.
A clarinet was vibrating sensuously and the men were standing up and
moving eagerly forward. We were a small tight group, clustered together, our
bare upper bodies touching and shining with anticipatory sweat; while up
front the big shots were becoming increasingly excited over something we still
could not see. Suddenly I heard the school superintendent, who had told me
to come, yell, ""Bring up the shines, gentlemen! Bring up the little shines!""
We were rushed up to the front of the ballroom, where it smelled
even more strongly of tobacco and whiskey. Then we were pushed into place.
I almost wet my pants. A sea of faces, some hostile, some amused, ringed
around us, and in the center, facing us, stood a magnificent blonde -- stark
naked. There was dead silence. I felt a blast of cold air chill me. I tried to
back away, but they were behind me and around me. Some of the boys stood
with lowered heads, trembling. I felt a wave of irrational guilt and fear. My
teeth chattered, my skin turned to goose flesh, my knees knocked. Yet I was
strongly attracted and looked in spite of myself. Had the price of looking
been blindness, I would have looked. The hair was yellow like that of a circus
kewpie doll, the face heavily powdered and rouged, as though to form an
abstract mask, the eyes hollow and smeared a cool blue, the color of a
baboon's butt. I felt a desire to spit upon her as my eyes brushed slowly over
her body. Her breasts were firm and round as the domes of East Indian
temples, and I stood so close as to see the fine skin texture and beads of
pearly perspiration glistening like dew around the pink and erected buds of
her nipples. I wanted at one and the same time to run from the room, to
sink through the floor, or go to her and cover her from my eyes and the
eyes of the others with my body; to feel the soft thighs, to caress her and
destroy her, to love her and murder her, to hide from her, and yet to stroke
where below the small American flag tattooed upon her belly her thighs
formed a capital V. I had a notion that of all in the room she saw only me
with her impersonal eyes.
And then she began to dance, a slow sensuous movement; the smoke
of a hundred cigars clinging to her like the thinnest of veils. She seemed like
a fair bird-girl girdled in veils calling to me from the angry surface of some
gray and threatening sea. I was transported. Then I became aware of the
clarinet playing and the big shots yelling at us. Some threatened us if we
looked and others if we did not. On my right I saw one boy faint. And now
a man grabbed a silver pitcher from a table and stepped close as he dashed
ice water upon him and stood him up and forced two of us to support him
as his head hung and moans issued from his thick bluish lips. Another boy
began to plead to go home. He was the largest of the group, wearing dark
red fighting trunks much too small to conceal the erection which projected
